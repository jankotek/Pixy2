	* AdjoiningPixelDetector.java: Recurrsive invokation of method
	  detectAdjoiningPixel is changed to while loop, because it
	  sometimes caused stack overflow if the image contains too large
	  adjoining pixels.

	* AdjoiningPixel.java: If the image has a huge bright area,
	  deblending takes too much time. So in that case, the system does
	  not deblend it.

Mon Nov  3 20:59:28 JST 2003  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* AdjoiningPixel.java: Defending too much deblended, especially in
	  the case of the out-of-focus image, based on the mean star image
	  radius sometimes caused too much blending. And the mean star
	  image radius was sometimes calculated illegally. So this process
	  is abolished.

	* Orbit.java: Kepler equation solving is modified to use random
	  value if it will not converge.

	  downloads images of newer dates, three images per date which are
	  composed into one median image, and starts examination on them.

Fri Oct 10 17:02:05 JST 2003  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* BaseDesktop.java: Bug fix. Showing the star chart with stars in
	  the database, stars out of the chart area were also added to the
	  list of properties.

	* IdentificationOperation.java: In the batch operation on XML
	  report documents, it checks if some stars are within the area at
	  first, and reads the XML report document only if some stars are
	  in the area.

Mon Aug  4 04:44:40 JST 2003  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* Fundamental restructure of class and package design, especially
	  on gui and pixy packages, at the following points:
	    - The toolkit package is created, in which several sub
	      packages are created. Each of the sub packages represents
	      one function, such as Variable Star Search, Star Database,
	      etc. All and only the GUI component classes and operation
	      classes related to one function are classified into one sub
	      package. 
	    - The pattern of class names related to one function is
	      unified. For example, VariableStarSurveyDesktop and
	      SurveyVariablesFrame are renamed as
	      VariableStarSearchDesktop and
	      VariableStarSearchInternalFrame.
	    - Inner classes become independent classes. Especially,
	      control panel and operation classes were often implemented
	      as inner classes, but become independent.
	    - When operation was included in the table class, the
	      operation becomes independent. All of the tables which
	      operate a function on the files displayed in them become
	      to follow a common framework of table-operation pattern.
	    - Operator and Operation are unified.
	    - Package names and class names are changed properly. For
	      example, Examiner is changed to Agent. Xml* are changed to
	      Report*. 
	    - Function names are changed as follows:
		o Create Image Gallery -> Image Conversion
		o Photometric Calibration -> Photometry Calibration
		o Bright New Object Survey -> Search New Star
		o Variable Star Survey -> Search Variable Star
		o Identification Overview Chart -> Identification Chart
		o Multiple Examination -> Image Collation
	      Especially, the "Multiple Examination" function, to overlap
	      two images and create R-GB or blink images, are changed to
	      "Image Collation", and moved under "Tool" menu. The
	      "Multiple Examination" button in the main panel is changed
	      to start the batch examination (not yet implemented).
	    - TemporaryDBManager, with methods to construct a temporary
	      database of detected stars only, is abolished. Instead, some
	      operation classes are created to construct a temporary
	      database. 
	    - The filechooser package is moved from gui to io.

	* The other points of change:
	    - Command line function is abolished.
	    - Option to calculate the gradient of magnitude translation
	      formula in pairing process is removed from the setting
	      dialog.
	    - Step-by-step help is abolished in Image Collation (or
	      Multiple Examination in the old version) is abolished.
	    - Filter classes on images are unified, even if overwriting to
	      the original buffer or creating a new buffer.
	    - The "Desktop" menu is changed to "Examination". The menus in
	      the main panel or desktops are changed to singular from
	      plural.

	* MtfFilter.java: Bug fix. In getFormat method, it invoked accept
	  by mistake.

	* NewvarReader.java: Format is changed. The V-I data in the OGLE-I
	  Periodic Variable Stars is deleted.

	* NewvarReader.java: The newvar-misao.cat is added in the help
	  message.

	* SearchXmlTable.java: Bug fix. If no star is found at the
	  specified position and the position is within the image field, 
	  it creates a not-seen magnitude record and shows to the
	  observation table.

	* XmlMagRecord.java: Methods getAttributes and setAttributes are
	  added.

	* relaxer.XmlMagRecord.java: Bug fix. If null is specified to
	  setUnofficial, setDiscarded, setPreempted or setImported, a
	  NullPointerException occurred.

Sun Jul 23 14:34:38 JST 2002  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - Matching by hand is supported. When the user click detected
	      stars on the chart after "Detect Stars" operation, it shows
	      the dialog to input the catalog data. Then it shows the
	      astrometry and photometry table using those catalog data and
	      creates the XML report document based on them. Instead it
	      skips automated matching and pairing operations.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.catalog.star
		UsersStar.java
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui.dialog
		UsersStarSettingDialog.java
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui.event

	  function is changed to 3600.0 so that one pixel will be one
	  arcsec.

	* CatalogManager.java: UsersStar is supported.

	* ChartComponent.java: Field star_click_handler and method
	  setStarClickEventHandler are added. If the handler is set, it
	  transfers the star click event to the handler and does not show
	  the star information message box by ifself.

	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: Matching by hand is supported. When
	  the user click detected stars on the chart after "Detect Stars"
	  operation, it shows the dialog to input the catalog data. Then
	  it shows the astrometry and photometry table using those catalog
	  data and creates the XML report document based on them. Instead
	  it skips automated matching and pairing operations. In order to
	  handle star click event, it sets event handler after "Detect
	  Stars" operation and resets it before "Matching" operation. The
	  event is handled in the new inner class
	  DetectedStarClickEventHandler.

	* XmlData.java: Method getStar(Star) is added.

	* XmlInformation.java: Bug fix to check whether the astrometric
	  error is null or not.

	* relaxer.DefaultPixyFactory.java: 
	* relaxer.IPixyFactory.java: 
	* relaxer.XmlInformation.java: 
	* relaxer.XmlPositionRecord.java: In the XML information document,
	  The <astrometric-catalog> element is abolished. Instead, the
	  <astrometry> element with <catalog> and <equinox> sub elements
	  is added. And the <equinox> element is added in the <position>
	  element.

	* CatalogManager.java: Method getAstrometrySupportedCatalogList is
	  added.

	* Tycho2Star.java: 
	* TychoStar.java: 
	* UsnoAStar.java: Method supportsAstrometry is added.

	* GscActStar.java: Bug fix. The detailed_output was not set as
	  true in the constructor, so only the R.A., Decl. and magnitude
	  were output.

	* IdentificationReportPane.java: 
	* IdentifiedStarTable.java: 
	* OverviewChartPane.java: 
	* PhotometricCalibrationFrame.java:

	  ImageInformationTable class.

	* PixyDesktop.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: They become to show the image
	  information table. New method showImageInformationTable is
	  added.

	* PixyDesktop.java: Menu "Astrometry" is added.

	* PixyDesktop.java: Codes to update the detected star chart and 
	  catalog data chart in photometryUpdated() is moved to new
	  private method updateCharts(), because the charts are also
	  updated in new methods of ReportDocumentUpdatedListener
	  interface. After the identification and setting parameters, it
	  invokes those new methods.

Sun May 12 19:34:20 JST 2002  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* AfaStar.java: Bug fix. Method setName was missed, so it failed
	  to create Star object from the XML document.

	* DatabaseCatalogTree.java: Bug fix. By changing the mode between
	  the full name and short name in the catalog and magnitude
	  database tree, it could not show the star data. 

	* Tycho2Star.java: Bug fix. In the default constructor,
	  initialization of field mag as 999.9 was missed, so it was
	  plotted as 0.0 mag star on the chart when read from the XML
	  document.

	* TychoVarStar.java: Bug fix. In setName, the field name was not
	  set properly, although it made no problem.

Tue May  7 19:11:07 JST 2002  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* DefaultLevelAdjustmentSet.java: The range estimation algorithm
	  is improved. It becomes to estimate the best range even if most
	  part of the image is covered with illegal pixels of same
	  value. Before the operation, it rejects those illegal pixels.

	* DefaultLevelAdjustmentSet.java: The range estimation algorithm 
	  is improved. Although it failed to estimate the range on same
	  images with strongly blooming stars, now it becomes to succeed.
	  It cuts off the illegal high value pixels.

Fri Apr  5 13:48:05 JST 2002  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - When registering a catalog to the database, the user can
	      decide whether to show the table to select XML files, and
	      whether to update the catalog database.
	    - Some more catalog stars are supported. 

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.catalog.star

	* The removed class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui
		AdditionalIdentificationTable.java

	* AdditionalIdentificationFrame.java:
	  AdditionalIdentificationTable is changed to
	  XmlBatchOperationTable, and AdditionalIdentificationOperation is
	  changed to XmlBatchAdditionalIdentification. 

	* CatalogManager.java: 
	* NewvarReader.java: AfaStar, Cgcs3Star, CfrsStar, DoStar,
	  Mfl2000Star, Ngc6712VStar, Ogle2BulgeStar, SdssCvStar,
	  TychoVarStar, UhaStar are supported.

	* NewvarReader.java: LBQS_B format is supported.

	* StarDatabaseDesktop.java: Method updateAllXmlFiles is added to
	  identify with registered catalog without showing the table of
	  XML files. In order to decide whether to show the table to
	  select XML files, and whether to update the catalog database, it
	  shows the RegisterCatalogSettingDialog at first when registering
	  a catalog.

Mon Feb 25 16:31:42 JST 2002  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - A batch operation menu to delete several XML files from the
	      database is added.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.pixy

	* GlobalDBManager.java: Method deleteMagnitude is added. Method
	  addMagnitude is renamed as updateMagnitude and changed as
	  private, into whose arguments a flag indicating to add or delete
	  is added. Now addMagnitude and deleteMagnitude just invokes
	  updateMagnitude. 

	* InformationDBManager.java: Method getPath is added to get the
	  relative path of the XML file.

	* XmlBatchOperationFrame.java: Menu "Delete from Database" is
	  added. 

Fri Feb  1 19:25:40 JST 2002  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* FileManager.java: 
	* MagnitudeDBManager.java: 
	* MagnitudeRecordTablePanel.java: 
	* XmlReport.java: Fast method to read the star element in the XML
	  report document file of the specified name, readStar, is
	  implemented. Catalog stars expansion in magnitude database tree
	  and creating mean R.A. and Decl. table became faster.

	* FileManager.java: 
	* SearchXmlTable.java: 
	* XmlReport.java: Fast method to read the XML report document with
	  only star data around the specified R.A. and Decl. is
	  implemented. Search data in the database with R.A. and
	  Decl. became faster.

Fri Jan 18 23:43:25 JST 2002  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - A desktop for photometric calibration is available. The user
	      can calibrate the photometry of images taken in the same
	      condition. The same base magnitude to convert the pixel
	      count to magnitude for all images.
	    - In order to avoid the out of memory, the user can create
	      some groups of XML files from the table, and operate
	      variable star survey on each group one by one. Wnen the user
	      selects some XML files on the table and select "Create Group of
	      Overlapping XMLs with" popup menu, the overlapping XML files
	      are automatically selected from the table and copied to
	      another table as one group.
	    - How to put the thumbnail images on the HTML image gallery
	      can be configured. The date and magnitude are output under
	      each thumbnail image.
	    - The standard Ic magnitude is supported. It can be calculated
	      from the standard V and B magnitude. 

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.database
		XmlReportQueryCondition.java
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui
		GroupedSurveyVariablesFrame.java
		GroupedSurveyVariablesTable.java

		PhotometricCalibrationDesktop.java
		PhotometricCalibrationFrame.java
		SurveyDesktop.java
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui.dialog
		HtmlImageGallerySettingDialog.java
		SearchXmlSettingDialog.java

	* AdditionalIdentificationTable.java: In order to confirm whether
	  some of the added data are really in the field of the image, it
	  tries to identify with empty XML report document at first. Only
	  when identified with some stars, it opens the real XML report
	  document file.

	* BloomingCancelFilter.java: Two bugs are fixed. When the radius
	  of a blooming star became 0 or less, it was converted to 0, but
	  now the minimum radius is changed to 0.5. While estimating the
	  center of a bloooming star, the array size to re-calculate the
	  threshold might be 0, so the size becomes to be checked before
	  sorting. 

	* BrightNewObjectSurveyDesktop.java: 
	* VariableStarSurveyDesktop.java: Common methods between the
	  desktops for the bright new objects survey and new variable star
	  survey, initialize() and initMenu(), and the inner class
	  ImportListener, are moved to the new super class
	  SurveyDesktop. Now the package can be exported and imported in
	  the bright new objects survey.

	* BrightNewObjectSurveyer.java: It may become faster. If a star
	  has the paired catalog data, the amplitude is checked only when
	  it is brighter than the limiting magnitude - amplitude
	  threshold. So faint stars are not picked up.

	* BrightNewObjectSurveyer.java: 
	* IdentifiedStarTable.java: 
	* Main.java: 
	* XmlData.java: They become much faster to show or operate. The
	  slow method XmlData#getStarCount was used in the sequential
	  access of all stars. Now the caution is described in the note of
	  XmlData#getStarCount. 

	* BrightNewObjectSurveySettingDialog.java: Bug fix. The name to
	  save the default value was wrong.

	* CatalogStar.java: 
	* GspcStar.java: 
	* MagnitudeSystem.java: 
	* Tycho2Star.java: 
	* TychoStar.java: The standard Ic magnitude is supported. It can
	  be calculated from the standard V and B magnitude. 

	* DataDesktop.java: XmlReportQueryCondition is added to the
	  argument of showSearchXmlTable(). It checks if each XML
	  information the which accessor returns can be accepted by the
	  query condition.

	* DataDesktop.java: When to create the HTML image gallery, a new
	  dialog appears to configure how to put the images on the
	  gallery. The images become to be sorted in order of date
	  anyway. Now only the image with brightest record, or two images
	  with brightest and faintest records can be selected.

	* DataDesktop.java: 
	* HtmlImageGallery.java: The date and magnitude are output under
	  each thumbnail image on the HTML image gallery.

	* DataDesktop.java: Debug code printStackTrace() is removed.

	* Desktop.java: 
	* MultiplePixyDesktop.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: The version and copyright information
	  become to be output on all log windows. The logging becomes
	  stopped at first, and the message to restart the logging are
	  output on the log window at the beginning.

	* GcvsStar.java: The stars with small letters, like mu Sgr or b
	  Per, become to be classified into the "other" folders, so that
	  the mu Sgr can be distinguished from MU Sgr.

	* IdentificationReportPane.java: 
	* IdentifiedStarTable.java: 
	* OverviewChartPane.java: 
	* PhotometryPane.java: 
	* PixyDesktop.java: 
	* ReportDocumentUpdatedListener.java: 
	* VsnetReportTable.java: The photometryUpdated method becomes to
	  require the updated XML report document in the argument.

	* ImageDatabaseDesktop.java: 
	* SearchStarSettingDialog.java: The range of the limiting
	  magnitude to search a star can be specified.

	* MagnitudeRecordTable.java: 
	* PositionRecordTable.java: The record with pixels from edge as 0
	  becomes to be sorted properly.

	* MagnitudeSystemSettingDialog.java: Buttons to show the help
	  message on the magnitude systems are added. 

	* Main.java: 
	* PixyDesktop.java: The writer to save the XML and PXF files
	  become to be created by Encoder#newWriter, so it can be saved in
	  the gzipped file.

	* MainFrame.java: New menu "Photometric Calibration" is added.

	* MonitorArea.java: 
	* MonitorFrame.java: Public methods stop and restart are added.

	* OperationControlPanel.java: Public method start is added.

	* PixyDesktop.java: The identification report table,
	  identification overview chart, photometry table, and VSNET
	  report table become closable.

	* SurveyBrightNewObjectsFrame.java: The "Restore XML Files" and
	  "Restore Images" menus are added. 

	* SurveyVariablesFrame.java: Because the sub class
	  GroupedSurveyVariablesFrame requires GroupedSurveyVariablesTable,
	  the sub class of SurveyVariablesTable, the content table becomes
	  to be created by the protected method createTable(). It is
	  invoked in the constructor.

	* SurveyVariablesFrame.java: When to search overlapping images,
	  the range of the limiting magnitude can be specified.

	* SurveyVariablesTable.java: The parent desktop is added to the
	  member field. It is used in the sub class
	  GroupedSurveyVariablesTable.

	* SurveyVariablesTable.java: Popup menu "Create Group of
	  Overlapping XMLs with" is added to find overlapping images with
	  the selected ones among the records in the table, and copy them
	  to the another table as one group. 

	* SurveyVariablesTable.java: Because only part of the records are
	  processed at the same time in the sub class
	  GroupedSurveyVariablesTable, the method survey() with a list of
	  target records are added. The public method survey invokes it
	  with all records. The inner class TwoPassMultiTasksObserver also
	  requires the list of target records.

	* Tycho2Star.java: Bug fix. The default magnitude was not set.

	* VariabilityChecker.java: Method getBrighterLimitingMagnitude is
	  added.

	* VariabilityTable.java: Bug fix. When exporting the package, the
	  catalog database was not created in the "database" sub
	  directory.

	* VariableStarSurveyDesktop.java: The frame member field to keep
	  another XML table to operate the grouped variable star survey is
	  added. New method getGroupedXmlSelectionTable is added to create
	  and return the table.

	* XmlBatchPhotometry.java: The base of the magnitude translation
	  formula is also output to the monitor.

	* XmlInformation.java: Method cloneEmptyReport is added.

	      user can search candidates of bright new objects among the
	      selected XML files. The limiting magnitude and amplitude can
	      be configured. The user can create the HTML image gallery of
	      all the candidates, where there is a link to the DSS
	      images, so the user can checks the DSS images easily.
	    - The URL, some parameters for the CGI program, and the output
	      format of the Minor Planet Checker are changed.
	    - Menu "Fill Dark Rows and Columns" is added. Bright pixels
	      can be blooming, not illegal pixels. In that case, this menu
	      works well, instead of "Fill Illegal Rows and Columns".

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui
		BrightNewObjectSurveyDesktop.java

	  method createDssAnchors is also added.

	* DataDesktop.java: The frame of magnitude data record table
	  becomes MagnitudeRecordTableFrame class.

	* DataDesktop.java: 
	* SearchXmlTable.java: Bug fix. Because a star cannot be detected
	  from all images, it checks whether the measured position is null
	  or not to create the observation table.

	* DefaultStarDetector.java: It rejects pixels around edges to
	  estimate the threshold to detect stars.

	* Desktop.java: 
	* MultiplePixyDesktop.java: 
	* PixyDesktop.java: 
	* XmlBatchOperationDesktop.java: The monitor set and the method to

	  been changed, the data saved in a file were not correct.

	* MagnitudeRecordTablePanel.java: Buttons to restore image files,
	  restore XML files and review examination are moved to the menus
	  of the frame.

	* Main.java: Option "-filter-fill-dark" is added.

	* MainFrame.java: Menu "Survey Bright New Objects" is added. Two
	  separator lines are inserted in the Tool menu.

	* MinorPlanetCheckerReader.java: The URL, some parameters for the
	  CGI program, and the output format are changed. The limit of
	  field of view is expanded to 15 deg from 5 deg. The date limit

	* The new functions:
	    - Now the user can select whether to correct the positions of
	      blooming stars while detecting stars from the image. New
	      option "-correct-blooming" is added.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui.dialog
		StarDetectionSettingDialog.java

	* BloomingCancelFilter.java: The list of blooming star positions
	  is reserved and can be got after the operation.

	* DefaultStarDetector.java: 
	* Main.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: Now the user can select whether to
	  correct the positions of blooming stars while detecting stars
	  from the image. New option "-correct-blooming" is added.

	* JulianDay.java: The Julian Day (like 2450000.0) can be also
	  read.

	* JulianDay.java: Bug fix. In the case of decimal date format
	  without space (like 20000101.12345), the accuracy was not
	  judged correctly.

	* MagnitudeRecordTable.java: The imported data can be listed up
	  in the table. The status of image files and XML files are not
	  displayed on them. The XML file name, ID, position are not
	  displayed, either.

	* MagnitudeRecordTable.java: Column "Blending" is deleted. Column
	  "Note" is added.

	* MagnitudeRecordTable.java: The date is formatted properly to
	  display.

	* MagnitudeRecordTable.java: Bug fix. When an imge file or XML
	  file object in the list is null, it does not try to restore it.

	* XmlMagRecord.java: In the case imported data, the XML file path
	  is null. So method getID considers it.

	* relaxer.XmlMagRecord.java: The elements <image-xml-path>, <name>
	  and <position> can be omitted. New element <note> is added.

	    - Catalog database is available. The user can register the
	      supported catalogs into the database. The user can also
	      identify stars in the image with stars in the catalog
	      database. 
	    - Image database and magnitude database are available. The
	      user can register an image into the database after
	      examination. Then the image information is saved in the
	      image database, and the magnitude data of identified stars
	      are saved in the magnitude database. 
	    - Star database desktop is available. The user can browse the
	      catalog database and magnitude database. The user can show
	      the catalog data and the magnitude data of every star.
	    - The extended VSNET/VSOLJ format is supported, which includes
	      the CCD chip name, reference catalog name, image observer
	      name, and optionally the description on the instruments.

		VsoljFormat.java

	* Astro.java: New constant value BESSELL_1900 is added. Note that
	  the value is actually J1900.0, not B1900.0.

	* CatalogDBManager.java: 
	* MagnitudeDBManager.java: They becomes to be the subclasses of
	  CatalogTreeManager and some methods to return database hierarchy
	  and star data in the specified folder are added. Because the
	  magnitude database does not contain the star data, it searches
	  the catalog database first, then searches data in the XML report
	  documents. 

	* CatalogDBManager.java: Method getElements is added, to get the
	  elements in the specified path in the name oriented database.

	* CatalogManager.java: New category "Catalog Errors" is added.

	* CatalogManager.java: New methods convertCategoryNameToFolder, 
	  convertCategoryFolderToName, convertCatalogNameToFolder, and
	  convertCatalogFolderToName are added for database browsing.

	* CatalogManager.java: Many new catalog readers and stars are
	  supported.

	* CatalogTree.java: It becomes a super class of
	  DatabaseCatalogTree class. Now the tree can contain the database
	  hierarchy, not only the catalog names. The displayNode and
	  CatalogSelectionListener#valueChanged methods are modified for
	  that. And getStar method is added, which must be overrided in
	  the subclasses.

	* CatalogTreePanel.java: The constructor becomes to require the
	  CatalogTree object, not the list of catalog names, so that any
	  types of catalog tree can be used.

	* CatalogTreeSelectionListener.java: Method selectStar is added.

	* ChartComponent.java: 
	* CreateGalleryFrame.java: 
	* InteractiveCatalogReader.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: 
	* MonoImageComponent.java: 
	* PixyDesktop.java: 
	* VsnetReportTable.java: Error message dialog is modifed to show
	  the error icon and caption, and warning message dialog is
	  mofidied to show the warning icon and caption.

	* Coor.java: Bug fix to read the accuracy of such a string as
	  "12h34m56s.78 +12o34'56".7" properly.

	* DefaultStar.java: The catalog category is changed from stars to
	  others.

	* DefaultStar.java: The position errors become to be calculated
	  based on the accuracy of R.A. and Decl.

	* Desktop.java: SelectWindowListener to select a window from the
	  Windows menu, and CloseWindowListener to remove the window's
	  name in the Windows menu when closed are added.

	* DetectedStar.java: The catalog name is changed from
	  "DetectedStar" to "Detected Star", and now it becomes to return
	  the catalog folder code and catalog category, so that the raw
	  data of detected stars can also be saved in the database. The
	  catalog hierarchy is divided into smaller piecies so that the
	  data of whole sky can be saved in the database. The position
	  error value is set and viewed as a property.

	* GalleryImageSelectionTable.java: Method getCellString becomes
	  protected from private.

	* Gcvs2000Reader.java: Bug fix. NSV stars were mis-classified. And
	  the description on NSV catalogs is added to the help message.

	* GcvsStar.java: 
	* IcStar.java: 
	* MisVStar.java: 
	* NgcStar.java: The number of stars in one folder in the database
	  is changed from 500 to 100.

	* GlobalDBManager.java: In order to show the status of each star
	  in progress while adding magnitude data of stars in one XML
	  report document into the database, it becomes to inherit the
	  MultiTasksObservable class and addMagnitude method invokes
	  methods to notify progress and status.

	* GlobalDBManager.java: The magnitude data of detected stars also
	  can be registered into the database.

	* IdentificationReportPane.java: The CatalogTree object is created
	  and set to the CatalogTreePanel.

	* IdentificationReportPane.java: The selectStar method is added to 
	  CatalogTreeSelectionListener interface, invoked when a star node
	  is selected.

	* IdentifiedStarTable.java: 
	* PhotometryResidualTable.java: 
	* PlotPropertyTable.java: 
	* RecordDistanceTable.java: 
	* VsnetReportTable.java: The sorting functions are moved to the
	  super class SortableTable. The getCellString method is moved
	  into the super class, so becomes protected from private. The
	  functions to put check boxes in the first column and handle the
	  check event are moved to the super class SortableCheckTable. 
	  Column renderers to show data as a string are unified in the
	  StringRenderer class. 

	* IdentifyFromDatabaseDialog.java: It was empty. The check box to
	  set whether to ignore negative data is added.

	* IrasPscStar.java: Bug fix. The flux less than 0.1 was not output
	  in proper accuracy.

	* JulianDay.java: Static method isDecimalDay is added.

	* Main.java: The VSNET/VSOLJ magnitude data output is changed to
	  use the VsnetRecord and VsoljRecord classes.

	* MagnitudeDBManager.java: Method getElements with Folder in
	  argument is added.

	* MagnitudeDBManager.java: In createDBFolder method, it throws
	  IOException when the folder hierarchy is null.

	* MainFrame.java: New menu Database is added to show the database
	  desktops.

	* MainFrame.java: Unofficial menu to register star data into the
	  catalog database is removed.

	* MinorPlanetCheckerStar.java: The VSNET name becomes not empty.

	* MisVReader.java: 
	* MisVStar.java: Modified due to the change of the MisV.dat file
	  format. The GCVS name, discovery date, and discoverers are
	  added, and the spectrum is removed.

	* PixyDesktop.java: The menu to register the XML report document
	  into the database is added.

	* PixyDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: The XML report document file name is
	  kept as a member field. It is required to register the document
	  into the database.

	* PixyDesktop.java: The menu to set the instruments is added.

	* PixyDesktop.java: The table to make a VSNET magnitude report is
	  completely changed.

	* VsnetReportSettingDialog.java: Due to the change of VSNET report
	  table, date and magnitude system are removed from the setting
	  dialog. The radio buttons whether to select the extented format
	  are added.

	* VsnetReportTable.java: Completely changed. Now it is based on
	  the list of VSNET magnitude records, not the XML report
	  document. So the date, magnitude system, and observer code can
	  be different among records. Every data string to show in a cell
	  is created by VsnetRecord class. The output string to the report
	  file is also created by VsnetRecord class. The table supports
	  the extended VSNET/VSOLJ format.

	* XmlData.java: Method getStar is added to get an XML star element
	  of the specified ID in the XML report document.

	* XmlData.java: The getIdentifiedCatalogList method becomes to
	  return the DetectedStar as one of the identified catalog star,
	  so that the raw detected data can also be saved in the database.

	* XmlPosition.java: Method getOutputString is added.

	* XmlStar.java: Method getTypicalVsnetName is changed to select
	  typical star name from the specified list of catalogs.

Wed Aug 29 22:39:16 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - The forth matching operation mode is implemented. In that
	      mode, the system tries to search the position of the image
	      within the search radius the user specified, while operating
	      matching repeatedly. It is useful when the position of the
	      image is quite uncertain.
	    - The GUI for retry matching up to 9 times is provided. It
	      helps success ratio of matching.
	    - The logging in the log window can be stopped and restarted
	      from the popup menu.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui
		MonitorArea.java
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui.dialog
		MatchingSettingDialog.java

	* Astro.java: New constant value double JULIUS_1900 is added.

	* CatalogStar.java: 
	* Coor.java: New accuracy indicating R.A. 12h34m56s,
	  Decl. +01o23'.4 is added.

	* Coor.java: Method precession is added.

	* MatchingCatalogSettingDialog.java: The item to skip matching is
	  removed.

	* MonitorFrame.java: Modified to use MonitorArea, in order to
	  provide the stop/restart logging operation in popup menu.

	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: In addition to the dialog to set the
	  catalog for matching, the dialog to select the matching
	  operation type also appears before matching. Now the retry up to
	  9 times and search position are also available.

	* RetryManager.java: New policy to search position within the
	  specified radius is added. The getCenterCoor method is modified
	  to pop data from the list one by one, that the list is created
	  in the setPolicy method.

Tue Aug 21 02:01:20 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - The third matching operation mode is implemented. In that
	      mode, the matching is operated normally, but the result is
	      judged based on the similarity to the initial parameters,
	      not on the score. It is useful for images with a few stars
	      when the accurate field of view and position angle are
	      certain.

	* GspcReader.java: 
	* GspcStar.java: The "The" in the name is removed.

	* Main.java: The "-skip-matching" options is abolished. Instead
	  "-accurate" and "-semi-accurate" options are added.

	* Main.java: 
	* MatchingOperator.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: MatchingOperator becomes to serve
	  three modes. One implies the normal matching operation
	  (MODE_UNCERTAIN). Another one implies to skip matching
	  (MODE_ACCURATE). And the other one implies to operate normal
	  matching, but the result is accepted when it is very similar to
	  the initial parameters (MODE_SEMI_ACCURATE). That means the
	  success or failure of matching process is not judged based on
	  the score, but the similarity. 

Mon Aug 13 20:46:34 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - The pairing process is refined still more. The upper limit
	      magnitude is determined properly even when the number of
	      stars is very small. And the number of NEW and ERR data does
	      not become much more than the STR data.

	* CatalogManager.java: New category "X-ray Catalog" is added.

	* CatalogStar.java: 
	* Coor.java: New accuracy indicating R.A. 12h34m56s,
	  Decl. +01o23'45" is added.

	* DefaultStar.java: Field category is removed. Because the
	  category cannot be saved in the XML record element, the category
	  must be the class-dependent value, not the object-dependent
	  value. The DefaultStar class belongs to the star catalog
	  category by default.

	* DefaultStar.java: In the case of clusters and nebulae, the plot
	  property is set as orange circle.

	* DefaultLimitingValueEstimator.java: 
	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: New field policy is added to the
	  limiting value estimator. In order to avoid the case that the
	  upper-limit magnitude becomes too faint when the number of stars
	  is small, it does not calculate the pairing ratio for and not
	  extend the limiting index to more data than the limiting index
	  obtained at first. When the limiting index cannot be determined,
	  it is set to the minimum window size.

	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: When the upper limit magnitude
	  becomes fainter than the limiting magnitude, it checks if the
	  limiting magnitude can be fainter, or the upper limit magnitude
	  is too faint. When more than half of the faint data between the
	  two magnitudes are paired, the limiting magnitude can be
	  fainter. Otherwise the upper limit is too faint.

	* PairingOperator.java: When the number of NEW data or ERR data is
	  twice, not three times, larger than the number of STR data, it
	  judges the examination is failed.

	* Verification.java: The LimitingMag-UpperLimitMag value is also
	  output.

Thu Aug  9 01:22:21 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - The pairing process is refined. Even if only a few stars
	      exist in the image, it can estimate the proper limiting
	      magnitude and not to detect many noises. It can make pairs
	      for stars with large proper motion, or maybe too bright
	      stars whose measured position is not accurate. It corrects
	      pairing even if the map function is not proper for whole
	      image, especially when the number of stars is too small or
	      the stars do not locate equally all over the image. In the
	      case the distortion field could not calculated properly, it
	      automatically assumes the image is flat and does not try to
	      consider the distortion field. When the number of stars is
	      too small, or the result seems to be illegal, it
	      automatically throws an exception and does not create XML
	      report document.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.pixy
		SupplementaryPairMaker.java

	* DefaultStar.java: It becomes to be the super class of most star
	  data, especially in newvar.cat file. So a new field category is
	  added to indicate the category of subclasses. Default
	  constructor is added. Method getNamePrefix() is added and the
	  methods getName(), setName() are modified to use it. Methods
	  getCatalogCategoryNumber(), getCatalogCategory(), 
	  getHierarchicalFolders(), getStarFolder(),
	  getPositionErrorInArcsec(), getMaximumPositionErrorInArcsec()
	  are added, which can be overrided in the subclasses. The default
	  property creates the magenta circle for a variable star,
	  otherwise the blue circle.

	* DefaultStar.java: Methods  setData() is added. Method
	  getKeyAndValues() is modified not to output keys for empty data.

	* DefaultLimitingValueEstimator.java: 
	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: The new field minimum_window_size
	  is added. In the old version, it was same as the
	  average_window_size, that is 19. So in the case the number of
	  stars is very small, too many stars were detected. But now the
	  minimum window size is 5 by default. And it tries to find the
	  proper limiting value estimating the paired ratio down to the
	  minimum window size. Therefore it can estimate the proper
	  limiting value even if only a few stars are in the image.	

	* DefaultVariableStar.java: The key "MagRange" is changed to
	  "Range".

	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: Using the SupplementaryPairMaker,
	  it makes pairs between the single detected stars and the single
	  catalog data after pairing closer than the search radius
	  determined depending on the magnitude. It helps to make pairs
	  for stars with large proper motion, or maybe too bright stars
	  whose measured position is not accurate.

	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: Bug fix. When the number of bright
	  paired stars is too small, illegal magnitude translation formula
	  was calculated and used. In that case, all of the paired stars
	  are used.

	* PairingOperator.java: 
	* ProgressivePairMaker.java: In the case the distortion field
	  could not calculated properly, it automatically assumes the
	  image is flat and does not try to consider the distortion field.

	* PairingOperator.java: When the number of paired stars is smaller
	  than 4, or the number of non-paired stars is more than three
	  times of number of paired stars, it throws an exception and does
	  not create XML report document.

	* PairingOperator.java: 
	* Verification.java: The status to indicate whether the
	  examination is successed or failed is added to verification
	  data.

	* PositionBasedPairMaker.java: Comment is modified.

	* ProgressivePairMaker.java: The search radius is expanded to 2
	  pixels from 1.5 pixels during position based pairing.

	* ProgressivePairMaker.java: Every time after the position based
	  pairing, it estimates the limiting magnitude and tries to make
	  pairs between the single detected stars and the single catalog
	  data brighter than Lm.-2.0 mag, closer than the search radius
	  determined depending on the magnitude, using the
	  SupplementaryPairMaker. It helps to correct pairing even if the
	  map function is not proper for whole image, especially when the
	  number of stars is too small or the stars do not locate equally
	  all over the image.

	* Star.java: Method getVsnetName() is modified to replace space
	  characters in the name by underscores.

Tue Jul 31 19:40:27 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - New menu to create image gallery is added. The user can
	      convert image format of many images at one time. The image
	      brightness is automatically adjusted. The index.html can be
	      also created so the user can see all of the images using the
	      WWW browser.
	    - JIMI, Java Image Management Interface, is supported. Now the
	      system can open/save JPEG/PNG/BMP files and open GIF/TIFF
	      files. 
	    - Drag and drop of an image or XML file from the native filer
	      application onto the PIXY System 2 desktop is supported.

	  ImageFileFilter#getFormat so that no modification is required
	  when a new format and filter is added. Only Fits is directly
	  constructed so that the UnsignedFits object is not craeted for
	  .fts, .fit, .ftis extensions.

	* Format.java: Method getTruncatedFilename is added.

	* ImageFileChooser.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: 
	* MultiplePixyDesktop.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: The file chooser to open an image
	  becomes ImageFileOpenChooser. The ImageFileChooser class becomes
	  a super class of both ImageFileOpenChooser and
	  ImageFileSaveChooser.

	* ImageFileChooser.java: Supported file filters are retrieved from
	  ImageFileFilter#getSupportedFilters so that no modification is
	  required when a new format and filter is added.

	* ImageFileChooser.java: Bug fix. When no filter is selected to
	  open an image, ClassCastException occured.

	* ImageFileFilter.java: 
	* MtfFilter.java: 
	* PpmFilter.java: 
	* SbigFilter.java: Method getFormat does not invoke Format#create
	  so that a Format object related to the filter can be created for
	  any File object. Therefore, the check for Mtf class is moved to
	  MtfFilter#getFormat from Format#create.

	* ImageFileFilter.java: Methods getSupportedFileFilters and
	  getBitmapFilters are added.

	* LabelTableCellRenderer.java: Icon is supported.

	* Main.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: Now that the system supports JIMI to
	  input/output GIF/JPEG/PNG/TIFF/BMP images, the existence of
	  JimiProClasses.zip is checked at the beginning.

	* MainFrame.java: New menu "Create Image Gallery" is added.

	* MainFrame.java: Bug fix. Even if the user cancels to open an
	  image or select a catalog to view the chart, a failed message
	  appeared.

	* MainFrame.java: Method initialize is removed because it is same
	  as that of the super class.

	* MonoImage.java: Method convertRGBToGray is added.

	* MonoImageComponent.java: The image can save in various formats,
	  not only the FITS format.

	* PixyDesktop.java: The extension of the image file is removed
	  from the default XML or PXF file name.

	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: Drag & drop from the native filer
	  application to the PIXY System 2 desktop is supported.

	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: Menu "Operations" is changed to
	  "Operation".

	* PlotPropertyTable.java: A cell editor to open a dialog becomes
	  the subclass of ButtonCellEditor. The listener becomes the
	  subclass of ButtonCellEditorListener.

	* PlotPropertyTable.java: Bug fix. After editing the table cell of
	  mark, the button did not disappear.

	* Ppm.java: Implements Bitmap.

	* Ppm.java: The name is changed from "ppm" to "PPM".

	* Resource.java: Icons for success/midway/error status are added.

	* UnsupportedFileTypeException.java: It becomes to have the URL,
	  format name and operation.

Sun Jul 15 18:37:17 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* VizieRUsnoAReader.java: Bug fix. Even if the accuracy of
	  R.A. and Decl. is increased as 0.001s and 0.01", it can reads
	  the data.

Mon Jul  9 21:13:24 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - The default FITS data order can be configured.
	    - The FITS data order can be specified and recorded in the XML
	      document. The default value is japanese order. So the
	      process based on the XML documents is not influenced by the
	      configuration.
	    - The smoothing filter and median filter can be applied before
	      the image examination. Options "-filter-smoothing" and
	      "-filter-median" are added.
	    - New element <instruments> is added.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui.dialog
		FilterSizeDialog.java
		ImageConfigurationDialog.java
	    - package net.aerith.misao.pixy
		XmlImageLoader.java
	    - package net.aerith.misao.xml

	* relaxer.IPixyFactory.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: 
	* PairingOperator.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* Resource.java: 
	* relaxer.XmlConfiguration.java: The default data order of the
	  FITS file can be configured. The main frame provides a menu
	  "Image Configuration". In the "Examine the image" operation, the
	  fits file is read in the configured default order, and the order
	  is recorded in the XML file. The DefaultImageLoader class
	  outputs the current order to the monitor.

	* DefaultLevelAdjustmentSet.java: Improved not to fail to
	  determine the proper minimum and maximum level even if high
	  value pixels remain after histogram smoothing.

	* Fits.java: It reads the FITS data in the configured data order.

	* Fits.java: 
	* Format.java: New method isFits is added.

	* Main.java: New options "-filter-smoothing" and "-filter-median"
	  are added.

	* Main.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: 
	* ThumbnailImageCreater.java: The image file is read using the new
	  class XmlImageLoader. The image is transformed properly as
	  recorded in the XML file: reversed, SBIG ST-4/6 image ratio
	  corrected, and the data order converted.

	* Main.java: 
	* XmlInformation.java: 
	* relaxer.XmlInformation.java: 
	* relaxer.XmlInstruction.java: 
	* XmlMagRecord.java: 
	* relaxer.XmlMagRecord.java: New element <instruments> is added to
	  the XML report, instruction and mag-record documents.

	* MonoImageComponent.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: Menus to apply smoothing filter and
	  median filter are added.

	* MonoImageComponent.java: Bug fix. When a filter is applied from
	  the popup menu, the default level adjustment did not work.

	* ThumbnailImageCreater.java: In order to create the thumbnail
	  image in the same order as the XmlMagRecord objects added to
	  this class, it contains Vector instead of HashTable. On the
	  other hand, it reads the image for every XmlMagRecord
	  object. But in general, all XmlMagRecord contain different
	  images. So it will not cause actual insufficience.

	* ThumbnailImageCreater.java: The resolution to create the
	  thumbnail image can be specified. The rotation of the image so
	  that the north is approximately up is implemented.

	* ThumbnailImageCreater.java: The method createThumbnailImage
	  becomes protected. So it only provides a way to create thumbnail
	  images by adding XmlMagRecord objects to this class.

	* relaxer.XmlImage.java: The attribute order is added.

	* XmlMagRecord.java: 
	* relaxer.XmlMagRecord.java: The <image> element is
	  removed. Because it is impossible to determine the pixel of the
	  recorded (x,y) position without the information recorded in the
	  XML report document, that is, the recorded (x,y) position is not
	  on the original image but on the reversed, SBIG ST-4/6 ratio
	  corrected, or data order converted image.

	* XmlMagRecord.java: Methods readReport and readInformation are
	  added.

	* XmlMagRecord.java: Bug fix. The (x,y) position was not recorded.

Sun Jul  1 18:22:18 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - Option "-skip-matching" is added to skip the matching
	      process. The GUI check box is also added.
	    - GUI check boxes for "-ccd" and "-flat" options are added.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui.dialog
		PairingSettingDialog.java

	* Main.java: New option "-skip-matching" is added to skip the
	  matching process.

	* Main.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: Bug fix. When jaxp.jar and parser.jar are not
	  installed, an ExceptionInInitializerError occured. So before
	  the error occurs, the system outputs the information to install
	  the files properly.

	* MatchingCatalogSettingDialog.java: 
	* MatchingOperator.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: The matching process becomes able to
	  be skipped. When to skip it, the user has to input the position
	  angle of up. A check box to skip it and a text field to input
	  the position angle of up are added to the
	  MatchingCatalogSettingDialog class. 

	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: A new dialog to set the parameters
	  for the pairing process is added, which contains check boxes to
	  fix the gradient of the magnitude translation formula and not to
	  calculate the distortion field in the pairing process.

	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: Bug fix. The blooming cancel filter
	  and streak cancel filter could not operated from the menu bar.

	* relaxer.XmlInstruction.java: Element <rotation> is added.

Sun Jun  3 17:05:20 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - The unsigned 16-bit FITS file is supported.
	    - The attribute "format" is added to the XML element <image>,
	      so that the image file format can be noted whatever the file
	      name is.
	    - The default catalog path can be configured in the
	      "Configuration" menu.
	    - Several paths separated by the path  separator (; or :) is
	      supported.
	    - Whichever the star catalog file or the XML file is gzipped
	      or not, the system can read it.
	    - The magnitude system to plot stars in the identification
	      overview chart can be configured by clicking the mark in the
	      plot property table.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.catalog.star

	* relaxer.XmlInformation.java: 
	* XmlInformation.java: 
	* relaxer.XmlInstruction.java: 
	* relaxer.XmlMagRecord.java: 
	* XmlMagRecord.java: The attribute "format" is added to the XML
	  element <image>. So the class of image file name is changed from
	  String to XmlImage.

	* UsnoA10Reader.java: 
	* UsnoA20Reader.java: 
	* VizieRUsnoAReader.java: Method setDefaultURL is added to
	  CatalogReader. The default catalog path is set in the
	  constructors of the sub classes using the method. So FileReader
	  becomes non-abstract class.

	* ChartComponent.java: When the star data is too long, it folds
	  the string when showing the dialog box.

	* DefaultImageLoader.java: In order to read the unsigned 16-bit
	  FITS, the Format object is also specified in the constructor.

	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: In order not to output the XML file
	  with no STRs, it limits the minimum number of STRs at 10 while
	  reducing stars to avoid too many NEWs.

	* FileReader.java: 
	* Gsc11Reader.java: 
	* Tycho2Reader.java: 
	* UsnoAReader.java: 
	* VizieRUsnoAReader.java: Whichever normal files or gzipped files
	  can be read using the new Decoder class.

	* FileReader.java: 
	* TychoReader.java: Bug fix. When the block size in the last block
	  is smaller than usual, an IOException was thrown because the
	  skip method could not skip the normal block size.

	* Fits.java: In order to support the unsigned 16-bit FITS image,
	  new method signed() is added.

	* FitsFilter.java:

	* MtfFilter.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: 
	* PpmFilter.java: 
	* SbigFilter.java: The file choosers of images comes to return the
	  proper Format object depending on the selected file filter. Now
	  the application should not create the Format object based on the
	  specified File object.

	* FloatBuffer.java: Bug fix. In setValue method, the value was
	  illegally converted to int value.

	* image.io.Format.java: 
	* ImageFileChooser.java: New image file format UnsignedFits is
	  added.

	* util.Format.java: Method separatePath can be invoked with null.

	* Gsc11Star.java: Bug fix. The format of the star name was changed
	  from "GSC 01234-01234" style to "GSC 1234-01234" style.

	* IONode.java: The write method to the file is added.

	* IONode.java: 
	* Main.java: 
	* TemporaryDBManager.java: Whichever the XML files are gzipped or
	  not, the system can read it properly.

	* Main.java: Bug fix. When a star was not detected, no data was
	  output using "-vsnet" or "-vsolj" options. Now the not-seen data
	  is output.

	* Main.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: 
	* Resource.java: The system initialization is described in the
	  static block of the Resource class. So now Resource#initialize
	  method is not required to be invoked in the application.

	* Main.java: 
	* PixyDesktop.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: The method to set the relative path
	  of the image file is moved to the XmlImage class.

	* MainFrame.java: 
	* Resource.java: New menu "Configuration" is added to configure
	  the default catalog path. The configuration becomes able to be
	  saved in the "pixy2.xml".

	* MainFrame.java: 
	* MatchingOperator.java: 
	* OpenCatalogPanel.java: Several paths separated by the path
	  separator (; or :) is supported.

	  catalog path in the text field is added.

	* PairingOperator.java: When the number of STRs becomes 0, an
	  ExaminationFailedException is thrown.

	* PairingOperator.java: Bug fix. In order to plot stars with a
	  proper color, the merged stars are unpacked after the pairing
	  process.

	* PixyDesktop.java: Not to cut the sequential number as suffix,
	  the default XML file name becomes the image file name itself and
	  ".xml" attached simply.

	* PixyDesktop.java: Bug fix. When an exception occurs while
	  identification, the error message box did not appear sometimes.

	* PlotPropertyTable.java: The magnitude system to plot stars can
	  be configured by clicking the mark in the plot property table.

	* URLSet.java: The flag is added, to search the gzipped files too
	  in exists and existsFile methods.

	* XmlData.java: Some stars have a large difference between the
	  detected position and the catalog position. So in the
	  getStarListAround method, it adjusts the radius if too small,
	  in order to catch a star whose catalog position is out of the
	  original search area but the detected position is in it.

	* XmlFilter.java: The flag whether to accept the gzipped XML files
	  or not is added.

	* XmlReport.java: Method readInformation from file is added so
	  that it can read the information whichever the XML file is
	  gzipped or not.

	* FileReader.java: 
	* Gsc11Reader.java: 
	* Tycho2Reader.java: 
	* UsnoAReader.java: The skip method sometimes takes some time for 
	  the process. So using the new StreamSkipTimer class, now they
	  can wait for some time until the skip process completes.

	* TriangleMatchingSolver.java: Comments modified.

Tue May 15 23:24:22 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - Double FITS file is supported.
	    - Option "-flat" is added to assume the image is flat and not
	      to calculate the distortion field.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.image
		DoubleBuffer.java

	* ArrayIndex.java: Even if the specified size is 0, the ArrayIndex
	  object can be created properly, although the index array was
	  null and not accessible in the old version.

	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: 
	* PairingOperator.java: 
	* ProgressivePairMaker.java: The flag to assume the image is flat
	  is added. When the flag is true, the distortion field is not
	  calculated.

	* FillIllegalRowAndColumnFilter.java: Bug fix. The "void" was
	  described in the constructor.

	* Main.java: Option "-flat" is added to assume the image is flat
	  and not to calculate the distortion field.

	  magnitude for the specified magnitude system, or throws an
	  UnsupportedMagnitudeSystemException. 

	* Fits.java: Modified to use the FitsDocument and FitsHeader
	  classes.

	* MagnitudeComparisonSettingPanel.java: 
	* RegularPhotometrySettingPanel.java: The
	  PhotometrySetting class is changed to have the catalog name and
	  the magnitude system code separatedly, and not to treat the
	  standard system as special.

	* MagnitudeSystem.java: 
	* PhotometrySetting.java: Completely changed. Because the
	  magnitude system code and the gradient of B-V are used not only
	  in photometry but also plotting stars, they are moved from
	  PhotometrySetting class to MagnitudeSystem class. Now
	  PhotometrySetting class has only members specified to
	  photometry, the catalog name and methods, in addition to the
	  MagnitudeSystem object.

	* MainFrame.java: 
	* PlotProperty.java: The magnitude system to plot stars is added
	  to the plot property. In the case of the chart with a single
	  type of stars, new SinglePropertyChartComponent is used, where
	  the magnitude system can be changed in the popup menu. The
	  method getMagnitude to get the proper magnitude for the system
	  of the specified star is added to PlotProperty class.

	* RegularPhotometrySettingPanel.java: The available standard
	  system codes are defined in the MagnitudeSystem class.

	* XmlData.java: In extractPairs method, now it uses
	  CatalogStar#getMagnitude.

	* XmlInformation.java: 
	* XmlPhotometry.java: Method getPhotometrySetting is added.

	* XmlMagRecord.java: In the case of the standard system, nothing
	  is recorded. In the case of the simple comparison, both the chip
	  code and the catalog are recorded. Otherwise, the chip code is
	  recorded.

Sat May  5 18:22:14 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - New option "-jd" is added to output the magnitude data with

	  supported.

	* DefaultLevelAdjustmentSet.java: Bug fix. When the current
	  minimum value becomes smaller than the minimum value of the
	  original image, it forces to set the minimum value of the
	  original image.

	* Format.java: PPM is supported.

Sat Mar 10 16:24:02 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:

Wed Feb 28 01:57:53 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - Photometry is supported. Using the star catalog containing 
	      the standard V and B-V magnitude, the user can measure the
	      magnitude of the standard system, or the instrumental system 
	      of some unfiltered CCD images using the system formula
	      obtained by Arne A. Henden, or the instrumental system of
	      the user's own while calculating the system formula at the
	      same time. Otherwise, simple magnitude comparison is also
	      possible. On the photometry residual table, the user can
	      select star data to use for photometry.

	* CatalogStar.java: Method getCoorStringWithoutUnit is added.

	* Coor.java: The R.A. and Decl. becomes to be kept by double, 
	  not float, in order to express the 0.001s and 0.01".

	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: Sometimes the number of NEW objects 
	  becomes too much larger than the number of STR objects. Then the 
	  limiting magnitude was illegally too faint and the size of the
	  result XML file became too much big. Now the system does not
	  yield too many NEW objects.

	* FileReader.java: Indexing framework is added for fast access.

	* Format.java: Bug fix. When the value almost equals 0, the method 
	  formatDouble output the exponential expression by mistake.

Sat Jan 27 23:51:47 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - Blending support for variable star survey. While seeking the
	      variable stars, the system calculates the blending magnitude
	      even if they are separatedly detected, when they are
	      blending on some image, so that the difference of blending
	      and separation will not affect the measured magnitude.
	    - New option "-search" is added to the command line operation,
	      which is to search the data at the specified R.A. and
	      Decl. in the database.
	    - New sub options -ignore-edge and -database-only are added to
	      the "-survey" option of the command line operation. They
	      means to ignore data nearby the edges, to ignore the XML
	      documents specified in the command line, respectively.
	    - New sub option -output is added to the "-survey",
	      "-survey-new" and "-survey-large-amplitude" options, which
	      is to output the result into a file.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.pixy

	* xml.relaxer.MagRecord.java: Some new XML elements are added.

	* AdjoiningPixel.java: 
	* SimpleStarDetector.java: Improved to solve the too much blending 
	  problems. The threshold to detect star pixels becomes 1.5 times
	  of the previous value. The threshold not to deblend two close
	  peaks becomes 0.5 pixels smaller. A pixel one pixel in both x
	  and y direction from another pixel is not blended to the pixel,
	  as same as the very old version. With the previous setting, many
	  close double stars could not be separated properly.

	* Array.java: The value is stored in double, not float, in order
	  to sort the Julian day properly.

	* Astro.java: Bug fix. The brightness ratio of 1 mag is changed
	  from 2.5 to 100^(1/5).

	* BloomingCancelFilter.java: Bug fix. In some case, it threw an
	  exception.

	* xml.Data.java: Method getStarAt is removed because it is
	  extremely slow.

	* DetectedStar.java: Method setName is implemented.

	* GlobalDBManager.java: 
	* IdentifiedStarTable.java: 
	* Main.java: 
	* OverviewChartPane.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: 
	* TemporaryDBManager.java: 
	* VsnetReportTable.java: Unneccesary array creation while
	  sequential access to the XML star elements is removed. The
	  operation becomes fast.

	* GlobalDBManager.java: 
	* MagnitudeDBManager.java: Blending support for variable star
	  survey. When the measured magnitude is the brightness of several
	  blending stars, the name of blending stars are recorded in the
	  temporary magnitude database. While seeking the variable stars,
	  the system calculates the blending magnitude even if they are
	  separatedly detected, so that the difference of blending and
	  separation will not affect the measured magnitude.

	* GlobalDBManager.java: If the (x,y) position is closer to the
	  edge than the specified threshold, the pixels from the edge is
	  also recorded in the magnitude database.

	* GlobalDBManager.java: Method addInformation is added for fast
	  operation. It is only for special use.

	* Identifier.java: When a catalog star is not identified with any
	  detected stars, it searches 10 pixels around and checks if the
	  catalog star position is within the radius of a big star image.
	  If so, it is identified with the star image.

	* xml.Information.java: Bug fix. In the copy constructor, it
	  created the objects in the net.aerith.misao.xml.relax package
	  instead of the objects in the net.aerith.misao.xml package.

	* xml.Information.java: Method read is added.

	* InformationDBManager.java: Method getAccessor to gets the
	  sequential accessor to the XML image information element which
	  covers the specified R.A. and Decl. is added. Two variations of
	  getAccessor implements are unified.

	* xml.Mag.java: Method blend is added.

	* xml.MagRecord.java: Methods addBlending and blending are added.
	  Method getOutputString is also modified.

	* Main.java: Method main throws an exception. Only when an
	  exception ocurrs while parsing the arguments, the help messages
	  are output.

	* Main.java: New option "-search" is added to the command line
	  operation, which is to search the data at the specified R.A. and
	  Decl. in the database.

	* Main.java: New sub options -ignore-edge and -database-only are
	  added to the "-survey" option of the command line
	  operation. They means to ignore data nearby the edges, to ignore
	  the XML documents specified in the command line, respectively.

	* Main.java: New sub option -output is added to the "-survey",
	  "-survey-new" and "-survey-large-amplitude" options, which is to
	  output the result into a file.

	* Main.java: When a folder is specified to the argument instead of 
	  XML files, it searches all XML files in the folder and sub
	  folders.

	* Main.java: While survey variable stars, it reads whole XML
	  report document only when required. Otherwise, it reads only the 
	  information element.

	* Main.java: The amplitude is formatted and output.

	* ProgressivePairMaker.java: In order to make pairs between
	  extremely bright stars and the catalog data, even if the
	  measured position is inaccurate, it searches within the radius
	  of the star images at the end of the progressive pairing
	  process.

	* xml.Report.java: When the OutOfMemoryError occurs, it waits for
	  one minute and invokes System.gc(), then tries to read the XML
	  document again, because sometimes the next XML document is read
	  before automatic garbage collection runs to delete the old
	  document.

	* xml.Report.java: Method readInformation is added.

	* SimpleLimitingValueEstimator.java: Bug fix. The peak index was
	  not added by mistake while limiting index estimation based on
	  the limiting ratio.

	* StringArray.java: Coding style of array is modified.

	* TemporaryDBManager.java: Some small modification. The limiting
	  magnitude is also specified for establish method, not to add the 
	  data of too faint stars into the database. When the XML report
	  document is not in the hash table even when to keep document on
	  memory, it reads the document and adds to the hash table. Class
	  access methods are moved to outside of the loop

	* VariabilityChecker.java: The data near by the edge can be
	  ignored.

Tue Jan  9 22:43:05 JST 2001  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - When the image, even only part of the image, is out of
	      focus, it estimates the mean radius of the star images and
	      avoids too much deblending consdidering the radius. In
	      addition, the new limiting magnitude and upper-limit
	      magnitude policy, the refinement of the limiting value
	      estimation process, and the blending faint catalog data to a
	      bright nearby star process, reduce the number of noises and
	      improve the quality of examination results.
	    - The retry operation of matching and the refinement of paring
	      process improve the examination success percentage.
	    - The SBIG format and MUTOH MTF format are supported. Note
	      that the MTF format class is not permitted to be open in the
	      public.
	    - While executing the PIXY System 2 with a batch XML file,
	      some options are added. The "-verify" option outputs the
	      parameters to verify the examination results. The "-ccd"
	      option assumes the image is obtained with CCD to estimated
	      the magnitude. The "-filter-streak", "-filter-blooming", 
	      "-filter-fill", and "-filter-equalize" options apply those
	      filters to the images.
	    - New sub option -period-window-size is added to the
	      "-survey" option of the command line operation. When to
	      ignore the scattering of magnitude within a short time,
	      specify the large interval. New sub option "-check-database"
	      is also added, which is to check the images in the database.
	    - New option "-database" is added to the command line
	      operation, which is to add the examination results into the
	      database.
	    - New option "-survey-new" is added to the command line
	      operation, which is to list up the bright NEW objects in the
	      examination results.
	    - New option "-survey-large-amplitude" is added to the command
	      line operation, which is to list up the stars whose
	      magnitude difference from the value in the catalog is large
	      in the examination results.
	    - In the command line operation, not only to enumerate XML
	      file names, the folder which contains XML files can be also
	      specified. 

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui.dialog
		ImageFileChooser.java
	    - package net.aerith.misao.gui.filechooser
		MtfFilter.java
		SbigFilter.java

	    - package net.aerith.misao.pixy
		RetryManager.java
		Verification.java
	    - package net.aerith.misao.util
		MeanStarImageRadius.java

	* AdjoiningPixel.java: 
	* SimpleStarDetector.java: In order to avoid the too much
	  deblended, especially in the case of the out-of-focus image, 
	  it calculates the equation which represents the relation between
	  the peak value and the radius of a star image based on some
	  bright star images. While deblending, if the distance of the
	  gravity centers of the two peaks is smaller than the mean
	  radius, they are not deblended. Only part of the image can be
	  out of focus. So it estimates the mean radius of a star image
	  for each part of the image.

	* Astro.java: In order to detect faint stars from the wide field
	  images, the limiting magnitude is shifted to be fainter.

	* Astro.java: 
	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: 
	* PairingOperator.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java:

	* BloomingCancelFilter.java: 
	* Main.java: 
	* MonitorSet.java: 
	* StreakCancelFilter.java: Method setMonitor is added to the
	  filter classes.

	* BloomingCancelFilter.java: When the image is turned left to the
	  right in the process, the x position of the blooming stars are
	  converted to the position on the original image when to output
	  to the monitor.

	* BloomingCancelFilter.java: Bug fix. Even after a star image is
	  deleted from the blooming list in the blooming cancel process
	  because the peak area is tiny, the peak pixel value was filled
	  by the left side pixel in mistake.

	* StreakCancelFilter.java: 
	* TemporaryDBManager.java: Once the thread object is created, it
	  will not be deleted from the memory by the garbage collector,
	  even when the run method is directly invoked without invoking
	  start method. Therefore, now the operators become not to be the
	  subclasses of the Thread class. And the operate method is
	  provided to be invoked directly. Although the run method does
	  not throw any exceptions, the operate method throws exceptions
	  if it occurs.

	* PxfWriter.java: 
	* VsnetReportTable.java: Not only the limiting magnitude, the
	  upper-limit magnitude is also calculated and recorded in the XML
	  document. It is used to show the upper-limit magnitude of
	  non-detected stars. The <upper-limit-mag> element may be
	  missing, but the proper upper-limit mag is available via 
	  xml.Information#getProperUpperLimitMag method anyway.

	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: 
	* PairingOperator.java: 
	* ProgressivePairMaker.java: The gradient of the magnitude
	  translation formula can be fixed as -1. If the calculated
	  gradient exceeds the range between -0.5 and -1.5, the gradient
	  is forcely fixed as -1. Anyway, the magnitude translation
	  formula is also output to the monitor.

	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: Detected stars fainter than the
	  limiting magnitude was remained if they are paired with catalog
	  data and the magnitude is within 2 times from the photometric
	  error from the limiting magnitude. However, it causes many false 
	  detections. So now the detected stars fainter than the limiting
	  magnitude are removed.

	* ExperiencedPairRefiner.java: When a catalog star is near by the
	  very bright star and not detected on the image, it is judged as
	  blending to the bright star, considering the radius of the star
	  image. 

	* Fits.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: 
	* MultiplePixyDesktop.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: 
	* SimpleImageLoader.java: 
	* ThumbnailImageCreater.java: The SBIG format and MUTOH MTF format
	  are supported. The specific file chooser dialog to open any
	  types of images, ImageFileChooser, is created. The abstract
	  class Format is created in order to deal with any types of image
	  files in the same style. Note that the MTF format class is not
	  permitted to be open in the public.

	* GlobalDBManager.java: 
	* xml.Information.java: 
	* Main.java: Trying to keep only the <information> element of the
	  XML report document on the memory, the whole report document
	  happens to remain on the memory. So in that case, clones the
	  <information> element and annuls the document.

	* xml.Information.java: Method getAstrometricErrorInPixel is
	  added.

	* MagnitudeTranslationFormula.java: Method getGradient is added.

	* Main.java: New sub options -verify, -ccd, -filter-streak,
	  -filter-blooming, -filter-fill, -filter-equalize are added to
	  the -batch option. New sub options -period-window-size,
	  -check-database are added to the -survey option. New options
	  -database, -survey-new and -survey-large-amplitude are
	  added. Not only to enumerate XML file names, the folder which
	  contains XML files can be also specified. 

	* Main.java: Retry of the matching is supported.

	* Main.java: Bug fix. When the path to output the XML, PXF, or log
	  file specified in the XML instruction document does not exist,
	  it creates the folders.

	* MatchingFailedException.java: 
	* SimpleMatchingSolver.java: 
	* TriangleMatchingSolver.java: The matching score is also
	  recorded in the exception. Method getScore is added to the
	  solvers.

	* MonoImageComponent.java: Bug fix. The "Equalize" menu was
	  missing.

	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: Bug fix. The image file recorded in the
	  XML document is searched not only based on the XML file path,
	  but also based on the current folder.

	* PositionMap.java: Method getArea is added.

	* ProgressivePairMaker.java: Sometimes, especially in the case of
	  wide field images, the examination was failed in the first step
	  of pairing. That was because the area size to search the pair
	  was too small. Now the search area radius is extended to at
	  least 15 from 5, which will be larger when the image size is
	  large. Progressing the sptes, the lower limit of the radius gets	
	  smaller, but in any step, the radius is determined considering
	  the image size. In addition, in order to avoid making false
	  pairs, only bright catalog data are passed to the
	  SimplePairMaker in the first step.

	* Record.java: When reading the XML report document, the StarImage
	  objects are enabled to output the R.A. and Decl. by default.
	
	* SimpleLimitingValueEstimator.java: Not only the limiting pixel
	  value of the detected stars, the limiting magnitude of catalog
	  data can be also estimated. In addition, in order to avoid the
	  bad influence of mis-pairs, only bright, well-paired, data are
	  used to estimate the limiting value.

	* StarImage.java: Method getRadius is added.
	
Sat Dec 30 15:27:27 JST 2000  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - The database management functions are added. Now the system
	      provides the functions to create and access to three types
	      of databases, the image information database, the catalog
	      database, and the magnitude database. The database can be
	      created on the disk or on the memory. The RELAX definition
	      to record the magnitude data is established.
	    - Registering the catalogs to the catalog database is
	      available, but no GUI is supplied yet. Identification with
	      the data in the database is also available, and the GUI is
	      supplied. Identification is also available using the
	      "-identify" option in the command line.
	    - Variable star survey from several overlapping XML report
	      documents is available. No GUI is supplied yet but the
	      "-survey" option for command line mode is supplied. Not only 
	      it outputs the data of possible variable stars which satisfy 
	      the specified conditions, it also creates the thumbnail
	      images.
	    - Using the "-gui" option, the main frame window appears also
	      from the command line.
	    - The "observer", "unofficial" and "note" are added to the XML 
	      report document.
	    - The "observer" and "unofficial" elements are added to the
	      batch XML.

	* xml.Record.java: 
	* xml.Star.java: Transformation between 
	  net.aerith.misao.util.star.Star and
	  net.aerith.misao.util.xml.Record is moved to the Record class
	  from Star class.

	* Star.java: The getKeyAndValues becomes to return the 0-size
	  array if there is no set of key and value, instead it returned 
	  null.

Tue Dec  5 19:10:24 JST 2000  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - The batch XML file format is established. Now the PIXY
	      System 2 can be executed in the command line with an option
	      "-batch" followed by the name of the batch XML file.
	    - The chip code is also recorded in the XML document.

	* JaxpNotFoundDialog.java: Method getMessages becomes final
	  static.

	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: The codes to operate matching and
	  pairng, and creation of the XML document are moved from
	  PixyOperationDesktop to independent class files MatchingOperator
	  and PairingOperator, now that the matching and pairing are also
	  run from the command line in Main class.

Tue Nov 28 02:13:18 JST 2000  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - Blooming cancel filter and streak cancel filter are
	      implemented.

	* The new class files:
	    - package net.aerith.misao.image.filter
		BackgroundEstimationFilter.java
		BloomingCancelFilter.java
		StreakCancelFilter.java
	    - package net.aerith.misao.pixy
		SimpleBackgroundEstimator.java

	* AdjoiningPixel.java: New methods getPixelCount, getPixels, and
	  those to get the maximum and minimum of x and y position are
	  added.

	* Array.java: New method cloneArray is added.

	* Buffer.java: 
	* ByteBuffer.java:

	  cancel filter are implemented.

	* SimpleStarDetector.java: The codes to create a sky image are
	  moved to a new class BackgroundEstimationFilter.

	* Statistics.java: Bug fix. The minimum value was always 0.0.

Sun Nov 12 22:17:25 JST 2000  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* JulianDay.java: Bug fix. Because the double day value was
	  converted to the int value just by cast, the result was
	  sometimes 1 second different. Especially, when the string value
	  in the specified accuracy was created, the value was not rounded 
	  properly. For example, 23:59 was rounded to 23h, not 0h of the
	  next day.

	* MinorPlanetCheckerReader.java: 
	* VizieRUsnoAReader.java: Help message is modified a bit.

	* PixyDesktop.java: Bug fix. The modified date and time was not
	  updated after identification, date and time setting, or filter
	  code setting.

	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: Bug fix. When the image is in the
	  root directory of a drive and the XML file is saved in the root
	  directory, running the system on Windows, the first letter of
	  the image file name is missed to be recorded in the XML file.

	* ProgressivePairMaker.java: Bug fix. The sign of inequality to
	  judge if the distortion field is erroneous was reversed in
	  mistake, so in the case of a wide field image, the distortion
	  was always canceled.

	* ProgressivePairMaker.java: Bug fix. When the loop count reaches
	  to the maximum limit in progressive pairing, only bright paired
	  data were returned, so all the NEW and ERR data and faint STR
	  data were lost.

Tue Nov  7 22:23:47 JST 2000  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - Identification with various catalogs is implemented. Now the
	      GCVS 2000, IRAS PSC, Minor Planet Checker, MisV and NGC
	      2000.0 are supported. The identification result can be
	      reviewed by the Identification Report and the Identification 
	      Overview Chart.
	    - The band like patterns on the image can be deleted by the
	      "Equalize" menu.
	    - The noise detection at the edge of the image is well
	      restrained.
	    - The mistake in pairing process is restrained by canceling
	      the distortion field correction if the distortion field
	      value is too big.
	    - The too many detection is restrained and the operation
	      process becomes fast.
	    - sample.xml is attached to the package, containing the 
	      identification result of the sample image.

	* The new class files:

	    - package net.aerith.misao.catalog
		Catalog.java

	* AdjoiningPixel.java: 
	* AdjoiningPixelDetector.java: 
	* SimpleStarDetector.java: In order to reduce the number of raw
	  detected data, the second threshold to judge the peak of the
	  adjoining pixels is added. Now it is set as twice of the
	  threshold to regard as star pixels.

	* Astro.java: Field BESSELL_1950 and method get_t2000 are added.

	* CatalogManager.java: 
	* CatalogReader.java :
	* CatalogStar.java: 
	* Gsc11Reader.java: 
	* Gsc11Star.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java:

	* UsnoA10Reader.java: 
	* UsnoA10Star.java: 
	* UsnoA20Reader.java: 
	* UsnoA20Star.java: 
	* UsnoAStar.java: 
	* VizieRUsnoAReader.java: The framework to deal with catalogs is
	  completely changed. In the old version, a Catalog object
	  represents one catalog with a catalog reader and a catalog star
	  class, and the CatalogManager creates and manages all Catalog
	  objects. In the new version, the catalog readers and catalog
	  star classes become independent. A catalog reader object has all
	  information on itself, and so does a catalog star class. The
	  CatalogManager has the list of all readers and star classes, and
	  methods to select some of them based on the specified
	  conditions. But it only refers to the information that the
	  readers and star classes have, and the mananger has no
	  information on each reader object or star class. As a result,
	  the Catalog class is removed.
	  In general, a catalog reader can create any catalog star
	  objects, and a catalog star object can be created by any catalog
	  readers. However, in the case of the catalogs for the PIXY
	  examination, they must be a pair of one reader and one star
	  class. So the CatalogManager has a special method to list up
	  available catalogs for the examination.
	  The CatalogManager also has a list of categories of star
	  classes, and a method to select the typical star class for VSNET
	  reporting.
	  The catalog reader has various methods to get the information on
	  the reader. All catalog readers have the help message.
	  The catalog star class also has various methods to get the
	  information on the class. All star classes have the default
	  property to plot stars on the chart. Each star class knows the
	  accuracy of itself, and the mapping on the PositionMap for fast
	  search or identification uses the accuracy.

	* CatalogReader.java :
	* Gsc11Reader.java: 
	* InteractiveCatalogReader.java: 
	* UsnoAReader.java: 
	* VizieRUsnoAReader.java: Now the QueryFailException is also
	  thrown in read and readNext method, when a reader accesses to
	  the web service like the Minor Planet Checker.

	* ChartComponent.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: The framework to plot stars on the chart
	  is completely changed. The ChartComponent has a list of
	  properties of each catalog. In the update method, it only
	  invokes the plot method of a proper PlotProperty object. That is
	  in order to plot stars of various catalogs with various marks. 

	* Coor.java: Framework to judge the accuracy of the R.A. and
	  Decl. is added. Now the create method can deal with inaccurate
	  format like "12h34m.56 +12o34'.5". Methods to output the
	  R.A. and Decl. in accuracy of "12h34m56s.7 +01o23'45"" are
	  added.

	* Coor.java: Method convertToXyz is added. 

	* Cubics.java: Method create to create the Cubics object from a
	  string is added. 

	* xml.Data.java: 
	* xml.Report.java: 
	* xml.Star.java: The XML Data element has a PositionMap for fast
	  search. The mapped position is obtained by 
	  xml.Star#getTypicalPosition method.

	* xml.Data.java: Methods getMaximumNumber and
	  getIdentifiedCatalogList are added.

	* Gsc11Reader.java: It supports to read the GSC-ACT catalog, too.

	* xml.Information.java: Methods getFovWidthInDegree,
	  getFovHeightInDegree, getChartMapFunction and getDistortion are
	  added.

	* MainFrame.java: 
	* PixyDesktop.java: The log window also appears in review mode.
	  The messages are also output to the console even in the review
	  mode.

	* MainFrame.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: The window title of the Catalog Star is
	  changed to the name of the catalog.

	* MatchingCatalogSettingDialog.java: 
	* StarChartSettingDialog.java: It uses the OpenCatalogPanel.

	* MedianFilter.java: 
	* SmoothFilter.java: 
	* SimpleStarDetector.java: In the old version, the image size
	  reduction, median filter and smoothing filter algorithms tend to
	  estimate the sky image around the edgemuch closer to the value
	  at the inner pixles. So many noises can be easily detected at
	  the edge of images. To avoid the noises, the filters use the
	  MonoImage#getValueOnFlatExtension method now.
	  In addition, in order to avoid the noises at the edge generally,
	  the sky images around the edge are estimated by 8x8 median
	  filter.

	* MonoImage.java: Method getValueOnFlatExtension is added.

	* Operator.java: Method getRunningException is added.

	* PixyDesktop.java: The menus "Identify", "Identification Report"
	  and "Identification Overview Chart" are added. The menu "Report" 
	  is changed to "Analysis". 

	* PixyDesktop.java: 
	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: A method enableXmlMenus is added in
	  order to enable all menus after the XML document is ready.

	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: A menu "Equalize" is added to
	  equalize the image.

	* PixyOperationDesktop.java: 
	* Resource.java: The help and tutorial messages are changed.

	* PixyReviewDesktop.java: Bug fix. If the image file is recorded
	  in the XML file without leading path, the system tries to open
	  the image file in the same directory as the XML file.

	* Position.java: Method getDistanceFrom is added.

	* PositionMap.java: Method getCenter, getDividedPositionMapList,
	  and divideByCircleCoverage are added.

	* ProgressivePairMaker.java: The mistake in pairing process is
	  restrained by canceling the distortion field correction if the
	  distortion field value is too big.

	* PxfWriter.java: Bug fix. In the case of "R|" records, the (x,y)
	  was not output.

	* RescaleFilter.java: Bug fix. Because of the error accumulation
	  of the float value, the rescaling did not work well when the
	  image size is (8n + 7).

	* xml.Star.java: The accuracy of R.A. and Decl. in the string is
	  concerned and set via CatalogStar#setAccuracy. It depends on the 
	  CatalogStar class if the accuracy of each object can be really
	  set or not.

	* xml.Star.java: 
	* StarList.java: Merged stars are unpacked in the XML document.

	* StarPosition.java: The default value of magnitude is changed
	  from 0.0 to 99.9, so that a very big dot will not be plotted on
	  the chart.

	* URelaxer.java: Modified so that it can read the XML document
	  with "&lt;", "&gt;" and "&amp;".

	* UsnoAStar.java: The preliminary V magnitude is also set in the
	  setKeyAndValue method.

	* VsnetReportTable.java: The rendering of a string object uses the 
	  LabelTableCellRenderer class.

	* The new functions:
	    - The examination result can be saved in the XML file, and can 
	      be completely reviewed by the PIXY System 2 in the review
	      mode. Now the system requires JAXP 1.0.1 to handle XML
	      document.
	    - The examination result can be also saved in the PXF file.
	      Although the PXF file cannot be reviewed by the PIXY System
	      2, it is easy to process by scripts like Perl scripts.

	* PixyDesktop.java: 
	* Resource.java: Review mode is added to review the examination
	  result saved in the XML file. The class structure of the PIXY
	  System desktop is changed. Now the PixyDesktop is a super class
	  of both the PixyOperationDesktop and PixyReviewDesktop, which
	  only contains common functions available after examination is
	  finished.

	* MainFrame.java: Now that the system requires JAXP 1.0.1 to
	  handle XML document, the existence of jaxp.jar and parser.jar is
	  checked at the beginning.

	* MergedStar.java: Method append() is added so that the
	  BlendingStar#append and UnifiedStar#append can be invoked by

	* The new functions:
	    - The system adjusts the brightness of an image automatically
	      before showing it on the display.
	    - The level adjustment dialog is improved. Now the histogram
	      is drawn on the dialog and the current range is pointed with 
	      two triangular marks. The slider range can be
	      magnified/reduced by pushing the Apply button. So the scale
	      of the slider motion becomes linear again.
	    - In the case of blink image and R-GB image, the level
	      adjustment of all images together is available.

	* The new class files:

	* BlinkMonoImageComponent.java: 
	* LevelAdjustmentDialog.java: 
	* MonoImageComponent.java: 
	* RGBCompositeImageComponent.java: The level adjustment dialog is
	  improved. Now the histogram is drawn on the dialog and the
	  current range is pointed with two triangular marks. The slider
	  range can be magnified/reduced by pushing the Apply button. So
	  the scale of the slider motion becomes linear again.

	* BlinkMonoImageComponent.java: 
	* LevelAdjustable.java: 
	* LevelAdjustmentDialog.java: 
	* MonoImageComponent.java:

	  at most by a thread.

	* LevelAdjustmentSet.java: Copy constructor is added.

	* MonitorFrame.java: When a message is added, it is scrolled to
	  the bottom automatically.

	* Resource.java: The sentense "Ken'ichi Torii, Makoto Yoshikawa,
	  and all misao-j ML members." is added in special thanks.

	* UsnoAStar.java: Bug fix. The R.A. and Decl. becomes printed as
	  12h34m56s.789 +01o23'45".67, not 12h34m56s.78 +01o23'45".6.

Sun Aug 27 17:49:23 JST 2000  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - Multiple examination mode. It is to compare two images. The
	      sytem automatically makes match between the two images and
	      creates a blinking image and an R-GB image.

	  the specified look up table. The framework of the image level
	  adjustment is chagend. Now it requires LevelAdjustable in the
	  constructor and applies the setting to the specified target
	  directly.

	* MainFrame.java: 
	* Resource.java: Multiple examination mode. It is to compare two
	  images. The sytem automatically makes match between the two
	  images and creates a blinking image and an R-GB image.

	* The new functions:
	    - New star catalogs, the USNO-A1.0/2.0 CD-ROMs and the query
	      result of the USNO-A1.0/2.0 catalog at the VizieR Service,
	      are supported. 
	    - All operations run as a thread independently with a priority
	      of 2, lower than the GUI threads, so that the user can start
	      any operations in parallel even when some operations are
	      running.
	    - Even if the system judged that matching failed, the user can
	      go to the next step when the matching was not really in fail.

	  failed map function is stored in the exception.

	* PixyDesktop.java: 
	* Resource.java: Even if the system judged that matching failed,
	  the user can go to the next step when the matching was not
	  really in fail.

	* PixyDesktop.java: 
	* SimpleMatchingSolver.java: Matching parameters are changed. The
	  limiting magnitude of catalog stars to use in matching becomes 1
	  mag fainter. The number of triangles of detected stars are
	  reduced, from 4 steps to 3 steps of tree. The threshold score to
	  judge matching succeeded is reduced from 0.45 to 0.35.

	* VsnetReportTable.java: The not-seen data becomes to be located
	  after all seen data by sorting.

Sun Jul 23 18:36:27 JST 2000  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* The new functions:
	    - Progressive pairing between the detected stars and the
	      catalog data after matching, considering the distortion
	      field. Now the system measures the very accurate

	* SimpleMatchingSolver.java: The number of catalog data used in
	  the catalog was too few. So it is increased as many as the old
	  version of the PIXY system. The triangle search mesh becomes
	  smaller, so matching process should be faster.

	* SimplePairMaker.java: Setting the color of stars is moved in the 
	  pair refiner class.

	  is modified from 1850.0 to 1875.0.

Sun Mar 12 10:06:49 JST 2000  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* PixyPairList.java: The threshold to select remarkable objects is 
	  now calculated based on the brighter one between detected
	  magnitude and catalog magnitude. In the old version, it was
	  based on the detected magnitude in principle. Therefore, a star
	  which is faint on the image but bright in catalog, or a star
	  which is faint on the image 1 but bright on the image 2 (in the
	  case of differential PIXY) was hardly selected as a remarkable
	  object.

	* PixyPairList.java: Adjustment of systematic shift of magnitude
	  is now based on the detected magnitude, while the adjusting
	  formula is calculated based on the catalog magnitude. In the old 
	  version, the adjustment was illegal in the case of remarkable
	  objects.

	* PixyKernel.java: In the case of differential PIXY, estimation of
	  the overlapping area ratio is improved. A bit inner pixels are
	  used.

Sat Mar 11 22:15:23 JST 2000  Seiichi Yoshida (comet@aerith.net)

	* MisaoRev.java: The file MisaoRev is splitted into two files,
	  MisaoRev and MisaoRev-novar. The format is also changed.
	  And now it can also read MisaoConfirm and MisaoSpecial files.

	* Coor.java: Method createCoor() can work on such a string as "01
	  23 45 +67 89.0", the declination has no element by second.

	* Astro.java: New method replaceString() is added.

Mon Dec 27 03:33:19 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PixyPairList.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: In differential PIXY, the system calculates the 
	  check magnitude and does not make thumbnail images of illegal
	  RM, RP and NP data if the difference of check magnitude is
	  smaller than the threshold. The check magnitude is calculated
	  based on the 7x7 pixels around the star, when the sky is
	  estimated based on the 11x11 pixels around the star. In
	  addition, the star within 5 pixels from the edges are also
	  rejected. The main methods of this function are:
	    PixyPairList#removeIllegalDifferentialPairs()
	    PixyKernel#measureCheckingMagnitude()

	* PairList.java: Methods createFirstList(), createSecondList()
	  creates a list including the dummy counterparts of non-pair data 
	  if the flag in argument is true.

	* DifferentialCheckImage.java: Do not make a thumbnail image of an 
	  illegal pair.

	* PairData.java: New member field illegal_flag is added. It is set 
	  true in differential PIXY if the difference of check_mag of two
	  detected data is smaller than the threshold.

	* DetectData.java: New member field check_mag is added. It is the
	  magnitude for check in differential PIXY.

Sun Oct 31 12:37:42 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* SolarXyz.java: 
	* OrbitPosition.java: 
	* Orbit.java: 
	* PastImageChecker.java: Application PastImageChecker is
	  improved. Now it supports comets and asteroids. It calculates
	  their positions for each image and checks if they are in the
	  image or not. In addition, it also checks if they are besides of 
	  past images using "area shift" parameter.

	* JD.java: New application to calculate Julian day.

	* VariableStarName.java: In order to avoid duplication of "mu XXX" 
	  and "MU XXX", and in the case of "nu" and "NU", the filename is
	  changed as "XXX_mu" for a star "mu XXX".

	* ImageGray.java: The weight for smoothing is accpeted as an
	  argument of method smooth_average().

	* ImageInformationList.java: New method readNextImageInformation()
	  is added, in order to read image information one by one without
	  keep all data on memory.

Sun Oct 24 01:53:08 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: New option -auto, -checkgallery are added for
	  differential PIXY. Now the system creates a frame of check image 
	  gallery after all. With option -checkgallery, the gallery image
	  is saved into a FITS file. With optin -auto, the frame will be
	  automatically closed just after the FITS image is saved.

	* DifferentialCheckImage.java: 
	* DifferentialGalleryCanvas.java: 
	* DifferentialGalleryFrame.java: New class files to create check
	  image gallery after differential PIXY.

Wed Sep 29 03:02:12 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PixyKernel.java: Calculattion of limiting magnitude to delete
	  faint data is improved in the case of differential PIXY.

	* PairList.java: New method removeRemarkableDataFainterThan() is
	  added.

Sun Sep 26 21:43:03 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* DifferentialPixyOutputData.java: 
	* DifferentialImageInformation.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: The overlapping ratio is output in PXF file of
	  differential PIXY.

	* DifferentialPixyOutputData.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Two new options are added to differential PIXY.
	  Option -noPS stops outputting PS data into a PXF file. Option
	  -checkimage creates mini FITS images for check of all RM, RP and 
	  NP objects.

	* PixyPairList.java: In the case of differential PIXY, "dMag",
	  "(dx,dy)" are used instead of "O-C(Mag)", "O-C(x,y)" in the memo 
	  field of a PXF file.

	* PixyPairList.java: Some methods became able to accept also
	  Position object, not only Coor object. Some methods are added
	  because now the second data of a pair can be DetectData object.

	* StarData.java: 
	* PairList.java: Bug fix on sorting in order of magnitude for
	  output of PXF file.

Sat Sep 11 20:29:58 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

Sun Aug 29 23:18:17 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MatchingFailedException.java: 
	* Pixy.java: The system retries to examine an image up to 9 times
	  by changing the default center coordinates in the batch mode. If 
	  the best score of matching is less than 0.2, the system
	  judges that matching is failed, and throws MatchingFailedException.
	  When the exception is caught, the system retries the operation.

Thu Aug 26 01:13:51 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MagnitudeDatabaseRecord.java: Bug fix of a method getY().

Sun Aug 15 16:18:09 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* CdromListUSNO.java: 
	* CdromListUSNOA10.java: 
	* CdromListUSNOA20.java: 
	* Catalog.java: 
	* CatalogIndex.java: USNO-A2.0 is supported. And the output format 
	  of USNO stars is changed. The star name is in such format as 
	  "USNO-A2.0_1111.22222222". One more figure is output for
	  R.A. and Decl.

	* Pixy.java: Prompt "Limiting magnitude to be detected at least: " 
	  is output for parameter "limiting_mag" in -console option.

	* Installer.java: The "GCVS_REV (iii.dat)" is listed before

	  of Variable Stars Astrometry, and FASTT-1 variable stars
	  catalog.

	* ReferenceCatalogBaseManager.java: The number of reference files
	  to be open at the same time is increased again up to 4. If less
	  than 4, identification with known variable stars takes too long
	  time.

Sat Jul 31 18:01:21 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MagnitudeDatabaseRecord.java: 
	* DetectionCheckTable.java: Format of magnitude database is
	  changed. Magnitude errors are deleted. Instead, (x,y) position
	  is recorded. The flag is in the independent column from memo
	  field. In addition, some access methods are added into 
	  MagnitudeDatabaseRecord class. Related to that change, now it is 
	  not required to put (x,y) into memo field when searching
	  candidates of new objects.

Sat Jul 31 13:35:53 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* FindDataAroundXY.java: New application to extract data around
	  the (x,y) user inputs is added.

Sat Jul  3 01:18:56 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PastImageChecker.java: It also outputs the data around the (x,y) 
	  position if PXF file exists.

	* PxfFile.java: New method readPxfFileOfImage() is added. It
	  creates some patterns of PXF filename from image filename, and
	  tries to open the PXF file for each.

	* VariableStarName.java: Bug fix. Data of supernovae could not be
	  stored into "supernova" folder.

Tue Jun 22 00:11:36 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MisV.java: Catalog format is changed.

	* VariableStarName.java: The magnitude data of MisV, TmzV, HadV,
	  OGLE objects and supernovae are stored into indivisual
	  sub-folders, although they were stored in the "others" folder.

Sun Jun 20 10:37:30 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* OgleBul.java: 
	* OgleLt.java:

	* PixyKernel.java: New parameter "limiting_mag" is added to set
	  the limiting magnitude by hand.

	* Updater.java: RM objects are not recorded in the magnitude
	  database. Only ND and NC objects are recorded.

	* NDChecker.java: The search area size to judge as the same star
	  is reduced from 5 pixels to 3 pixels.

Wed Jun 16 21:34:40 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PixyPairList.java: Bug fix of a method adjustMagnitude().
	  Magnitude of only paired stars were re-calculated properly.
	  So the magnitude of ND objects were illegal in the old version.

Tue Jun 15 01:18:02 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MagnitudeDatabaseStar.java: 
	* MagnitudeDatabaseManager.java: 
	* Updater.java: 
	* Pixy.java: In order to remove data from magnitude database of a
	  PXF file, new option "Pixy -update -remove" is added. New
	  methods MagnitudeDatabaseManager#setToDelete,
	  MagnitudeDatabaseStar#empty, MagnitudeDatabaseStar#removeRecord,
	  Update#setToDelete are added.

Sun May  9 11:52:39 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* "package misao.contrib.imdisp;" is inserted into Java files in 
	  misao.contrib.imdisp package.

	* VariableStarName.java: Bug fix. Magnitude data of MisE objects
	  were saved into obs/error/others/ instead of obs/error/misao/.

Tue May  4 20:52:15 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* DetectionCheckTable.java: Several bug fix.
	     - Reading PXF file of a past image, the data were not located
	       on the map index properly. One bug is that the R.A. and
	       Decl, instead of (x,y), are used by mistake. Another bug is 
	       that the (x,y) of any data except for ND objects are set as 
	       (0,0) by mistake. It means, only DetectData has (x,y) but
	       CatalogData does not after reading a PXF file. So the
	       system could find any data in past PXF files except for ND
	       stars.
	     - Sometimes very far star was selected as the same star by
	       mistake.
	     - While reading PXF files of past images, (x,y) is appended
	       repeatedly to the record sometimes.
	     - The (x,y) of the current night's records were not output
	       when the data were already registered into the magnitude
	       database.

	* MagnitudeDatabaseManager.java: 
	* DetectionCheckTable.java: The mesh size becomes half by half, so 
	  search becomes faster.

	* DetectionCheckTable.java: 
	* NDChecker.java: While reading magnitude database, midway
	  progress is output to System.err.

	* ProgressManager.java: New class file to print midway progress.

	* PrintManager.java: It can also print messages to System.err.

Mon May  3 22:05:04 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MisaoPreliminaryObject.java: 
	* MisaoPreliminaryObjectName.java: 
	* IrasObject.java: 
	* MagnitudeDatabaseRecord.java: 
	* MagnitudeDatabaseStar.java: 
	* MagnitudeDatabaseUpdateElement.java: 
	* MagnitudeDatabaseManager.java: 
	* Updater.java: 
	* DetectionCheckTable.java: 
	* NDChecker.java: Class files in misao.database package are
	  improved drastically. Major advantage of this change is speed
	  up of magnitude database update (Pixy -update) and new objects
	  survey (Pixy -survey). The output format of new objects survey
	  is changed at the same time. Now it outputs only real ND data
	  (noises are removed), being classifed into four classes:
		- Candidates of new objects
		- Candidates of variable stars
		- Normal stars
		- No data in past

	* MapElement.java: 
	* MapIndex.java: 
	* CelestialMapIndex.java: New class files. They are used for fast
	  search of points and coordinates. MapIndex class is for flat
	  rectangle area. CelestialMapIndex class is for globular whole
	  sky.

	* Astro.java: Method doubleValueOf() is improved. Now it can
	  create double value of such a string as "+10.2CIR".

	* VariableStarName.java: The character ':' is also added to be
	  rejected in filename.

Sat Apr 10 17:37:27 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PastImageChecker.java: New application to output (x,y) of a star

	* Installer.java: New class file to install MISAO new variable
	  stars, MisV, into the identification database is added.

Tue Mar 30 03:34:23 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* CatalogManager.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* Pixy.java: When the system cannot read the star catalog CD-ROM
	  data, it always waited until the user set the CD-ROM and hit the 
	  RETURN key. But it caused to interrupt examining several images
	  at one time by batch mode. So the system now skips to examine an 
	  image when it cannot read CD-ROM, and continues to examine all
	  images in a batch file.

	* Astro.java: 
	* MagnitudeTranslationFormula.java: 
	* PixyPairList.java: The 1 mag step ratio is modified from 2.512
	  to 2.5.

	* DetectionCheckTable.java: Bug fix. When no path of PXF files is
	  specified, Pixy -survey died by NullPointerException.

Fri Mar 12 07:45:12 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MagError.java: Method createMagError can read Not-a-Number value 
	  in magnitude dependent error field (Na.00).

	* DetectionCheckTable.java: Bug fix. NullPointerException could be 
	  thrown.

Wed Mar 10 05:51:08 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MisEGsc.java: 
	* MisEUa1.java: 
	* MisF.java: 
	* Installer.java: New class files to install MisE.GSC, MisE.UA1,
	  MisF catalogs into the identificaiton database are added.

Fri Mar  5 14:05:42 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* ConstellationTable.java: A dummy class file is also created for
	  misao.secret.util.ConstellationTable class.

	* ImageFileMtf.java: 
	* ImageFileBin.java: These dummy class files did not work well in
	  misao.util package. So they are moved into misao.secret.util 
	  package.

Tue Mar  2 14:59:25 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* ImageFileMtf.java: 
	* ImageFileBin.java: These class files are secret. But when
	  running JDK1.2 on solaris system, JVM requires these class files 
	  to compile whole program. So dummy class files are put in the
	  public package.

Sun Feb 21 13:01:55 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: Usage output is modified.

	* NDChecker.java: Mistake of spelling is modified

Sat Feb 20 09:59:15 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* CatalogViewer.java: Bug fix. Forgot to modify catalog data
	  loading style caused by the bug fix on reading several CD-ROMs
	  in several paths.

	* DetectionCheckTable.java: Search area size becomes variable
	  depending on the pixel size, although it was fixed as 2 pixels
	  in the old version. The minimum size is 1.5 pixels.

Wed Feb 17 07:44:32 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: Option -survey is added to list up candidates of new
	  objects. It creates NDChecker object and run NDChecker#operate().

	* DetectionCheckTableElement.java: 
	* DetectionCheckTable.java: 
	* NDChecker.java: These class files are moved from misao.secret
	  package into misao.database package. The NDChecker is changed as 
	  non-application class. In addition, it reads image information
	  list and old PXF files and searches counterparts of recent ND
	  data. 

	* MagData.java: Method getMemo() is added.

	* MisaoProperty.java: 
	* ImageInformationList.java: 
	* Updater.java: List of ImageInformation data is also created
	  under MISAO home directory by Pixy -update.

	* Updater.java: 
	* Pixy.java: The application misao.database.Updater is united with
	  misao.pixy.Pixy.

	* CdromList.java: 
	* CdromListGSC.java: 
	* CdromListUSNO.java: 
	* CatalogManager.java: Bug fix. Reading several CD-ROMs in several 
	  paths did not work properly.

Sun Feb 12 11:48:29 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* DetectionCheckTableElement.java: 
	* DetectionCheckTable.java: 
	* NDChecker.java: New application to check if the detected ND
	  stars are real stars or just noises, NDCheckert, and some
	  related new class files are added. But the application is in the 
	  secret package.

	* CoorAccuracyConcerned.java: New subclass of Coor.

	* ImageInformation.java: 
	* PxfFile.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: Member field mag_code is added in
	  ImageInformation.

	* MagnitudeDatabaseManager.java: Bug fix. The filename of MISAO
	  preliminary objects whose declination is south of +0 deg was
	  wrong in method findMisaoPreliminaryObject(). Therefore, the
	  same star in the database could not be found properly.

	* MagnitudeDatabaseManager.java: New public methods
	  setReadOnly() and getMisaoDataList() are added.

	* Updater.java: New public method createMagData() is added.

	* PairData.java: New public method hasReference() is added.

	* MagData.java: New public methods isDetected(), setImage(), 
	  appendMemo() are added.

	* Pixy.java: Comment modification.

	* MatchingFrame.java: Bug fix on usage of
	  StarData#getFirstAppendix and StarData#getNextAppendix.

Sun Jan 24 20:45:45 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* ImageGray.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: Bug fix of median filter. The median value was
	  set in the same image buffer, before applying the filter to the
	  rest of pixels. So the result was somewhat wrong. As a result of 
	  this change, ImageGray#median becomes to return ImageGray
	  object now.

Thu Jan 14 15:13:32 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Identifier.java: Bug fix. In the case of ND data (no catalog
	  position is obtained and the detected position is inaccurate), 
	  stars are identified even if the positional difference is large.
	  The limit is 1.414 times of pixel size.

Wed Jan 13 19:23:05 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: 
	* Updater.java: When an exception is thrown while operating on one
	  PXF file in batch mode, the system catches it and output error
	  message to System.err, then goes to next PXF file. In the old
	  version, the system stopped and further PXF files were not
	  operated at all.

	* Coor.java: Method createCoor can analyze such String
	  data as "01h23m45s.67 +01o23'45".6", or "012345.67
	  +012345.6".

Mon Jan 11 15:31:45 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* VariableStarName.java: 
	* MagnitudeDatabaseManager.java: 
	* Updater.java: Because there are too many MISAO preliminary
	  objects and IRAS objects, magnitude data of each star cannot be
	  save in one file independently. So the data of MISAO preliminary
	  objects and IRAS objects are classified based on the R.A. and
	  Decl. 

	* Updater.java: Output current filename in batch mode.

	* Pixy.java: Output current filename in batch mode while
	  identification. 

	* Updater.java: Bug fix. When inserting an old magnitude data, the 
	  data was duplicated by mistake.

Fri Jan  8 13:56:07 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Updater.java: Do not accumulate magnitude data of nebula, even
	  if being identified with a variable star or a suspicious
	  variable star.

Thu Jan  7 19:32:27 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Updater.java: Stop outputting "blending" in the case of NC or NR
	  data. In addition, also output "edge" in memo field if the
	  detect data is close by edge.

	* Updater.java: Every blending catalog data of a RM or NC object
	  is registered as a preliminary MISAO object, although only first
	  data is registered in the old version.

	* PhotometricReporter.java: Output style of blending stars is
	  changed. In addition, ':' is appended after magnitude in the
	  case at edge.

	* PhotometricReporter.java: Two bug fixes. One is, I forgot to
	  close PrintManager object. Another one is, the report was output 
	  only to System.out, not through PrintManager object, so the
	  report could not be saved in a file anyway.

	* PixyPairList.java: 
	* PxfFile.java: Method PixyPairList#selectAtEdge() is added. If
	  (x,y) of detect data recorded in PXF file is close by edge, now
	  edge_flag of the data is set.

	* PairData.java: New method isBlending() is added. Method
	  getAliasList() returns a new Vector object, not the member field 
	  itself.

	* Identifier.java: Stop trimming the residual list for every
	  catalog data in a check file.

Thu Jan  7 14:18:39 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MagData.java
	* MisaoPreliminaryObjectName.java
	* MisaoPreliminaryObject.java
	* Updater.java: New package misao.database is added, for
	  acuumulating magnitude data of variable stars, suspicious
	  variable stars and preliminary MISAO objects. The class
	  misao.database.Updater is the application to read PXF file and
	  update database.

Wed Jan  6 09:20:57 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: Identification with batch file is supported. The
	  usage is: java misao.pixy.Pixy -identify -batch <batch file>.
	  In batch file, the pair of PXF filename and ICL filename should
	  be written in each line. In addition, -noNR option is added to
	  stop outputting all variable stars in the image but not
	  identified with any detected stars or catalog data.

	* Installer.java: The default position error is enlarged as 1.5
	  arcsec -> 5.0 arcsec, 0.5 arcsec -> 1.5 arcsec.

	* VariableStarName.java: VSName.java is renamed and renewed.

	* Identifier.java: Maximum search area size is limited at 600
	  arcsec, in order to avoid taking so long useless time when
	  positional error in PXF file is extremely big.

Tue Jan  5 16:44:11 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PixyPairList.java: Bug fix. Removal of nonsense blending catalog
	  data could not work properly. Only one nonsense data was removed 
	  but others were remained.

	* MisaoProperty.java: 
	* Installer.java: New static methods MisaoProperty#createHome and 
	  MisaoProperty#create*Directory are added. In Installer, the
	  reference directory is created if it does not exist.

Sat Jan  4 11:39:38 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MagError.java: New method getDependentError(double) is added.

	* JulianDay.java: Method createJulianDay can analyze such String
	  data as "1999 Jan  4.12345".

	* PairData.java: Unnecessary public static final int fields are
	  deleted.

Sat Jan  2 15:24:59 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MagnitudeAdjustment.java: Two bug fixes. One is, the index to
	  calculate adjustment value sometimes became -1. Another one is,
	  getDeltaMag() threw an exception in the case magnitude in
	  argument is out of range.

	* MagError.java: Bug fix. Sometimes the mag0 in dependent error
	  formula could not be calculated properly.

	* CdromListGSC.java: Bug fix to create catalog data of detail
	  output.

	* CdromList.java: 
	* CdromListGSC.java: 
	* CdromListUSNO.java: Method load() is delcared to throw
	  Exception, not limited to only CdromNotFoundException.

Fri Jan  1 19:49:02 JST 1999  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* MagError.java: 
	* PairList.java: 
	* PixyPairList.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* ImageInformation.java: New magnitude error estimation technique
	  is adopted. Selection of remarkable objects is changed to be
	  based on the technique. New magnitude error consists of two
	  types of errors, constant error and dependent error on the
	  brightness. Constant error is a starndard deviation of 50 bright 
	  stars. Dependent error is expressed in the formula: 
		log_2.512 (delta-mag) = 1/2 (mag - mag0)
	  So now the constant error and mag0 value (the dependent error
	  becomes 1.0 at the magnitude) are printed in PXF file. Actually, 
	  the dependent error is not a deviation but the threshold to
	  separate remarkable objects and other objects. So it cannot be
	  called "error" in an ordinary meaning.

	* PixyPairList.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: Limiting magnitude estimation is changed. Now
	  the faintest magnitude is determined at first based on the
	  old-style limiting magnitude. Then the standard deviation of
	  magnitude at faintest magnitude is calculated. The limiting
	  magnitude is calculated again as:
		limiting mag. = faintest mag. - 3 * deviation
	  ND and NC data are printed until the new limiting magnitude.

	* MagnitudeAdjustment.java: 
	* PixyPairList.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: Magnitude adjustment process is added in order
	  to adjust systematic shift of magnitude between detected stars
	  and catalog data.

	* PixyPairList.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: Judgement to blend or to ignore catalog data
	  close by another data is moved from PixyPairList#blendCatalogStars
	  to PixyKernel#operate. The judgement policy is also changed. 
	  Now, if the magnitude difference between before and after
	  blending is larger than half of constant magnitude error, or
	  magnitude difference of both catalog data is smaller than 1.0
	  mag, they are blended. Otherwise, the fainter data is removed.

	* PixyKernel.java: When removing NC data at edge, data within 5
	  pixels from edge are to be removed. In the old version, the
	  threshold was determined by the position error.

	* PixyPairList.java: Method removeCatalogNonpairDataAtEdge() is
	  renamed as removeCatalogNonpairDataOutOfImage().

	* PixyPairList.java: The codes of method cancelPairs, being no
	  longer invoked, are deleted.

	* StarData.java: Method removeAppendix() is added.

	* Astro.java: Method blendMagnitude() is added.

	* Document bug fix. When both detected magnitude and position
	  differ from those in catalog data, it is regarded as RM, not RP.

Mon Dec 28 14:53:50 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PhotometricReporter.java: 
	* Pixy.java: New option -report is added. It outputs the
	  photometric report from a PXF file. New class PhotometricReporter
	  is created for this function.

	* VariableStarFinder.java: New small application to find variable
	  stars in the identification database around the position the
	  user inputs.

	* CdromNotFoundException.java: 
	* CdromList.java: 
	* CdromListGSC.java: 
	* CdromListUSNO.java: 
	* CatalogManager.java: Stop waiting for the hit of RETURN key
	  after CD-ROM is set in CdromList#checkCdrom. Instead, the system 
	  waits in CatalogManager#loadCatalog now. CdromList#checkCdrom
	  throws a new exception CdromNotFoundException, which is caught
	  in CatalogManager#loadCatalog. This modification is because
	  several CD-ROM drives can be set at one time now in the PIXY
	  system. 

	* DetectData.java: Method getMagCode() is added.

Sun Dec 27 11:16:05 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: The parameters exposure_start exposure, and pos_error 
	  can be omitted in Q&A style.

	* JulianDay.java: Bug fix. The time is becomes earlier by one
	  second while repeating toString() and createJulianDay().

Thu Dec 24 09:01:33 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Astro.java: 
	* PixyInputData.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* Pixy.java: New input parameter "sbig_ratio" is added in order to 
	  examine ST-4/6 image properly.

	* DetectData.java: 
	* DetectList.java: 
	* PixyInputData.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* Pixy.jav: New input parameter "mag_code" is added. The code is
	  put after magnitude of each detected star. It should be like:
	  'R', 'C', 'V', etc.

	* Pixy.java: Comment in batch file is supported. A sentense
	  beginning with ';' or '#' is regarded as a comment.

	* DetectData.java: 
	* PixyPairData.java: Stop putting '*' in the record of a detect
	  data at edge. Instead, some codes are added in PixyPairData to
	  output a message "Detected star is at edge." for such a pair in
	  memo field. However, the new codes are commented out. So now
	  nothing is output in PXF file to point out a detect data is at
	  edge. 

	* Pixy.java: When reviewing the result of a mirror image, the
	  image becomes mirrored and viewed, as same as the PIXY's view.

	* Coor.java: Bug fix. Method direction(Coor) could not calculate
	  proper direction when this.declination is +/- 90.0 deg.

	* HadV.java: Bug fix. Only first identified data in ID list was
	  output into reference database.

Thu Dec 17 11:11:27 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Astro.java: In sortStringList and sortStringKey, stop using
	  Collator and CollationKey classes because they caused some
	  trouble on Windows95. Now String#compareTo is used for
	  comparison. 

Wed Dec 16 05:51:33 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PairData.java:
	* PixyPairData.java:
	* Identifier.java: Member fields type, name, and alias_list become
	  protected. The elements in alias_list is changed to
	  ReferenceData from String. Related methods are modified.

	* ReferenceType.java: 
	* ReferenceName.java: 
	* ReferenceData.java: 
	* ReferenceCatalogBase.java
	* ReferenceCatalogBaseManager.java
	* PairList.java: 
	* PixyPairList.java: 
	* Identifier.java: Reference catalog data for identification are
	  classified into 5 types: V (variable stars), S (suspicious
	  variable stars), E (catalog errors), N (nebulae and clusters), O
	  (other objects). FYI, in the old version, the catalog data are
	  classified into 2 classes: 0 and 1. New class ReferenceType is
	  added. All class files in misao.ref package and identification
	  class files are modified. The type is also recorded in PXF file
	  at the head of each object's name. So new class ReferenceName is
	  added, which is a set of type and name.

	* Pixy.java: Help message is also output when illegal options are
	  used.

	* MISAO identification database installation class files are added
	  in the ditribution package as misao.ref package (originally
	  misao.install package).

Tue Dec  8 04:46:08 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* ImageFileMtf.java: 
	* ImageFileBin.java: 
	* ImageType.java: 
	* ImageFile.java: Mutoh MTF/BIN file format reader classes are
	  added into misao.secret.util package. These classes are not
	  permitted to be distributed.

	* ConstellationChecker.java: This new small application class is
	  added into misao.secret.app package.

Sun Dec  6 23:48:47 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: Method printHelp is added. Without any options, the
	  help messagea on usage are output.

	* Dbvs.java: 
	* DbvsData.java: 
	* Identifier.java: 
	* MisaoProperty.java: 
	* ReferenceCatalogBase.java: 
	* ReferenceCatalogBaseManager.java: 
	* ReferenceData.java: Some class files in misao.host package are
	  added into distribution package. Now only the file above are
	  included, required to run identification.

	* Identifier.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Identification is modified based on the new PXF file
	  format. The output is now also in PXF file. Identification is
	  run in a class Pixy with -identify option now, so the
	  application misao.host.Identifier is abolished. LogAnalyzer and
	  LogData classes are no longer used. DAT file is abolished. The
	  additional information (distance of identified data, double
	  identifications, etc.) can be output into check file.

	* PairData.java: 
	* PixyPairData.java: 
	* PairList.java: 
	* PixyPairList.java: Modified to treat NR objects.

	* PairData.java: Method getAliases is added. Methods addMemo and
	  addReference are refined not to keep same records.

	* All class files are about being included in the distribution
	  package, except for class ConstellationTable, which is moved
	  into misao.secret.util package.

Sun Dec  6 20:45:33 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* CatalogViewer.java: Modified based on the new catalog management 
	  style.

	* Catalog.java: Methods getMagLimit, getFovLimit and loadImage are 
	  added.

	* CatalogIndex.java: Methods getFirstImageCatalog/getNextImageCatalog
	  are added.

	* Distance.java: Refined a bit.

Sun Dec  6 16:37:11 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Modifications on PXF file reading and data restoration.

	* Pixy.java: Option -log is changed to -review. Method
	  analyzeLogFile is renamed as analyzePxfFile. 

	* ImageInformation.java: Method setParameter(Parameter) is added
	  for restoration.

	* PixyInputData.java: Setting catalog based on the name is also
	  enabled, not only based on the code.

	* PixyPairList.java: Method setAllCatalogPosition is added to
	  restore (x,y) of catalog data at reading PXF file.

	* PairList.java: 
	* PxfFile.java: Method read(DataInputStream) is added for reading
	  PXF file.

	* DetectData.java: 
	* CatalogData.java: 
	* CatalogList.java: 
	* CdromListGSC.java: 
	* CdromListUSNO.java: 
	* PairData.java: 
	* PixyPairData.java: Restoration method createFoo(String) is added
	  for a class Foo. Restoration of CatalogData object is
	  implemented in each sub class of CatalogList.

	* PixyType.java: Static value NP1 and NP2 are added.

	* PixyOutputData.java: Constructor PixyOutputData(LogAnalyzer,
	  String) is abolished. Restoration of PixyOutputData object is
	  now implemented in Pixy#analyzePxfFile.

	* LogData.java: 
	* LogAnalyzer.java: These class files are abolished.

	* CatalogIndex.java: Some public methods to get a list of catalogs 
	  are added.

	* PixyPairList.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: PixyPairList#setAllPositions is renamed as 
	  setAllDetectCoor.

	* Pixy.java: Only CD-ROM star catalogs are available for PIXY
	  examination. 

Sun Dec  6 06:29:14 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: New option -batch is added. It reads parameters from
	  a batch file and runs the PIXY system. Batch file format is
	  based on the PXF file format.

	* Big modification caused by the establishment of a new PXF file
	  format.

	* PxfFile.java: New class of PXF file format.

	* PixyInputData.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: Printing format becomes based on the PXF file
	  format.

	* PixyInputData.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Parameter setting format by -arg option becomes based
	  on the PXF file format. Setting style by -console option is also
	  refined.

	* Parameter.java: 
	* PixyInputData.java: Parameter setting style is changed as
	  setting one by one based on a class Parameter, although all
	  parameters are set at one time via the constructor in the old
	  version.

	* ImageInformation.java: 
	* PixyOutputData.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: Most member fields in a class PixyOutputData, to
	  be reused on review, identification or so, are moved to a new
	  class ImageInformation. Now PixyOutputData is not Printable, the
	  method print(PrintStream) is abolished. The printing function is
	  also moved into the new ImageInformation class.

	* PairList.java: 
	* PixyPairList.java: Modified related to the PXF format
	  establishement. Printing process becomes much refined. New
	  methods setAllNames is added, which determines the sequential
	  number of PS, RM, RP, NP objects. Some methods are overrided in
	  the sub class PixyPairList to use ND and NC codes instead of NP.

	* PixyPairList.java: Position error and magnitude error of
	  remarkable pairs is printed in memo field in PXF file by a
	  method setRemarkableErrorInMemo.

	* PairData.java: 
	* PixyPairData.java: PairData class is improved and a new sub
	  class PixyPairData is created. New member fields name,
	  alias_list, memo_list and reference_list are added to PairData
	  class. This addition is caused by a new PXF format
	  establishment. Methods on printing are also added. New class
	  PixyPairData is craeted with some specific functions for
	  printing in PXF format.

	* CdromListUSNO.java: 
	* CgiListUSNO.java: 
	* CgiListUSNOVizieR.java: Loading data in R/B mag is also possible 
	  by invoking a standard method load() after setting the magnitude 
	  mode. In the old version, the superior class must have invoked
	  non-standard methods loadRmag()/loadBmag().

	* Catalog.java: 
	* CatalogIndex.java: 
	* CatalogManager.java: 
	* PixyInputData.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Management of accessible star catalogs is dynamically
	  changed. A new class Catalog is created and most functions are
	  moved into the new class. CatalogIndex becomes only to have a
	  list of accessible catalogs. The PIXY system remembers the
	  current catalog by reserving a Catalog object, not remembering a
	  int value. The superior classes hardly have to be cousious of
	  the difference between CD-ROM and WWW.

	* CatalogList.java: Modified to set R.A. and Decl. as member
	  fields.

	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: In order to print the proper (x,y) of detected
	  stars, all positions are shifted as (x,y) becomes offset from
	  top-left corner at the end of operate().

	* DetectData.java: 
	* DetectList.java: 
	* PixyPairList.java: New constructor DetectData(Position) is
	  added, to be a counterpart of a NC object. Private type field is
	  added to create a proper record in getRecord(). Detail/simple
	  format selection is also by the type field. It can be controlled
	  via setPrintSimple()/setPrintDetail(). The counterparts of NC
	  objects are created by PixyPairList#createDetectDataOfNC.

	* DetectData.java: 
	* PixyPairData.java: 
	* PixyPairList.java: Positional error and magnitude error are
	  removed from the member fields of class DetectData. Some related
	  methods and calculateErrorPosition are also removed. Errors are
	  now calculated on demand using fields mag and coor, in a class
	  PixyPairList. The R.A. and Decl. is set via
	  PixyPairList#setAllPositions.

	* DetectData.java: 
	* DetectList.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: String record is removed from the member fields
	  of class DetectData. Method getRecord creates a String object on
	  demand. The codes of getRecord() is originally
	  DetectList#setRecord, which is abolished.

	* PrintManager.java: Moved to misao.util package fron misao.pixy.

	* Cubics.java: 
	* Quadrics.java: 
	* DistortionField.java: Small change on printing.

	* JulianDay.java: Method createJulianDay is improved. Now it can
	  analyze such String objects as both "1998 Jan 31 01:23:45" and 
	  "1998 1 31 1 23 45".

	* Coor.java: New method residual() is added.

	* Coor.java: New method createCoor() is added to restore a Coor
	  object from a String object.

	* Astro.java: New methods to analyze a String object of numeric
	  value are added, doubleDegreeValueOf(String) and
	  doubleSecondValueOf(String). They can analyze such String
	  objects as "1.0 deg",  "12.3 arcmin", etc., and return the value 
	  in degree/second.

	* CatalogCanvas.java: Bug fix of invoking
	  StarData#getFirstAppendix and StarData#getNextAppendix.

Thu Dec  3 18:46:15 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PixyPairList.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: Most pairs whose position error is large are
	  just mis-pairs and the detected counterparts are often noises. 
	  So mis-pair removal function is restored as 
	  PixyPairList#removeMispairData. If the both data are fainter
	  than limiting mag and position error is larger than 1.5 pixels, 
	  the system removes the pair. Position error in degree is no
	  longer concerned.

	* StarData.java: 
	* PairType.java: 
	* PairList.java: 
	* PixyPairList.java: Color setting process is modified. Class
	  StarColor is abolished.

Thu Dec  3 14:18:01 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* DistortionField.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: In order to avoid a trouble that all stars are
	  failed to be paired sometimes in part of the image, pairing
	  process is improved.
		- PairList#rejectMisPairedData, invoked twice after quasi
		  pairing and final pairing, is abolished. Paired data
		  whose positional error is larger than 1 arcmin and 1.5
		  pixel were removed in this old method.
		- Between quasi pairing and final pairing, precise pairing 
		  is added. It repeats pairing until the distortion field
		  converges. Partial pairing failure was caused by the
		  distortion field was too large at edge even after quasi
		  pairing. 

	* PixyKernel.java: Stop regarding a non-pair detected star close
	  to another star as a mistake in star catalog of close double
	  star blending. PixyPairList#pairingBinaryStars is no longer
	  invoked. 

	* PairList.java: 
	* PixyPairList.java: Some methods which assume the pair data must
	  consist of a detected star and catalog data are moved to a new
	  class PixyPairList. Methods in the original PairList class can
	  work on a pair of two PairData objects.

	* PairType.java: 
	* PairData.java: 
	* PairList.java: 
	* DistortionField.java: 
	* PixyOutputData.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: New class PairData is created which consists of
	  paired two data. All class files related to pairing is modified
	  based on this new class.

	* DetectData.java: 
	* DetectList.java: 
	* PsfDistribution.java: 
	* SelectStarIndex.java: 
	* LogAnalyzer.java: Class DetectStarData is renamed as
	  DetectData. 

	* CatalogData.java: 
	* CatalogList.java: 
	* CdromListGSC.java: 
	* CdromListUSNO.java: 
	* CgiListGSC.java: 
	* CgiListHIPTYC.java: 
	* CgiListTycho.java: 
	* CgiListUSNO.java: 
	* CgiListUSNOVizieR.java: 
	* CgiListYcbs.java: New class CatalogData is added as an extension
	  of StarData. Additional member fields against StarData are id
	  and record.

	* StarData.java: String record is removed from members. Coor coor
	  is added as a member.

	* MatchingFrame.java: Bug fix. The size was not doubled by
	  mistake, but it was just misunderstanding by CatalogManager's
	  bug (see below).

	* CatalogManager.java: Bug fix. When enabling to set several paths
	  for CD-ROM drives, I forgot to set the unit of CatalogList
	  properly.

	* StarList.java: New constructor StarList(Vector) is added. The
	  Vector object should contain StarData objects.

	* Astro.java: New static member ILLEGAL_MAG is added.

	* Copyright message is inserted into all Java files.

Sat Nov 28 02:31:24 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* New package misao.contrib.imdisp is added. It contains some
	  class files to read FITS file implemented by Taichi Kato.

	* ImageFileFits.java: FITS file reading is improved by using
	  misao.contrib.imdisp.*.

	* CatalogViewer.java: 
	* ImageViewer.java: These two applications are moved into
	  misao.app package from misao.pixy.

	* PixyInputData.java: 
	* CatalogManager.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Enable to set several paths for CD-ROM drives.

	* PixyOutputData.java: Opening a log file by -log option, it also
	  searches the image file in the current path.

	* PixyKernel.java: Bug fix. In the case of a negative image, the
	  noise must be estimated again however it was omitted.

	* LogAnalyzer.java: Bug fix. If (x,y) in a log file is greater
	  than 1000, the biggest figure was left out.

	* ImageViewer.java: Bug fix. Size was too small.

	* MatchingFrame.java: Bug fix. Size was doubled.

Sat Nov 14 18:56:04 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* ImagePixy.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: The system sometimes failed to judge if the
	  image is negative or not in the old version. Now it checks the
	  number of stellar pixels after reversing the image, and restores 
	  it if the image is not negative in fact.

	* Distance.java: A small application to output angular distance
	  between two points in the sky.

	* LogAnalyzer.java: Bug fix. I forgot to remove codes about the
	  abolished option "image is flat".

Wed Nov 11 13:18:46 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PixyOutputDataInterface.java: 
	* PixyOutputData.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Some classes are added for test of star detection and 
	  matching into a new package misao.pixy.test. Some codes in these 
	  existing classes are also modified accordingly. Test functions
	  are available by running PIXY system as:
	      java misao.pixy.Pixy -test <command>

	* PixyOutputDataDetect.java: 
	* DetectFrame.java: New test classes to check raw detected stars.

	* PixyOutputDataMatching.java: 
	* MatchingCatalogCanvas.java: 
	* MatchingChartFrame.java: 
	* MatchingFrame.java: New test classes to check data used for
	  matching.

	* CatalogCanvas.java: For convenience at extension, two methods,
	  drawBackground() and drawForeground() are added. They should be
	  overridden in a subclass. The trigger methods are also added. 
	  One more, calculation of a star's (x,y) becomes in a method
	  getStarPoint(). 

	* TriGraph.java: Some methods are added to draw the graph in
	  MatchingCatalogCanvas. 

	* TriStarsIndex.java: Constructors become public.

	* ChartFrame.java: Almost all member fields are changed as
	  protected from private.

	* PixyInputData.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: 
	* Pixy.java: An option "image is flat", to assume that the image
	  is flat, is abolished.

Fri Oct 30 02:01:11 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PixyKernel.java: 9 bright pixels around the peak are used to
	  calculate the position, although 21 pixels were used before. It
	  brings higher accuracy.

	* ImageFileFits.java: 
	* ImageFileGif.java: 
	* ImageFileJpeg.java: 
	* ImageFilePgm.java: 
	* ImageFilePpm.java: 
	* CdromListGSC.java: 
	* CdromListUSNO.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Reading data from file becomes faster by using
	  BufferedInputStream.

	* SelectStarListIndex.java: Two bugs are fixed. The mesh size was
	  not proper and extra blocks were created at right and
	  bottom. Another bug was that stars at edge or cosmic rays were
	  not ignored by mistake. 

	* AdjoinPixel.java: Bug fix. The argument of construct() was
	  passed as reference at first by mistake. So one pixel in each
	  adjoining pixels was changed illegally.

Sun Oct 25 11:38:57 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* ImageGray.java: 
	* PixyKernel.java: Negative image is automatically recognized and
	  reversed. If an image is nagative, the number of stellar pixels
	  becomes usually 0, otherwise the ratio the number of stellar
	  pixels per all pixels is about several percent.

	* SelectStarListIndex.java: Stars which may be cosmic ray and the
	  area size is less than 3 pixels are also ignored in matching,
	  not only stars at edge. The 3-pixel limitation is for JPEG/GIF
	  images. 

	* DetectList.java: Print peak value and area size for each
	  detected star in detail mode.

	* Astro.java: New method sortStringKey() is added.

Wed Oct 14 12:43:23 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* StarData.java: 
	* CatalogCanvas.java: 
	* PairList.java: 
	* MainFrame.java: Add a new function to plot stars as a circle,
	  not a dot.

Sun Oct 11 15:30:49 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* The general design of class files is changed.
	    - The system is separated into some small classes depending on 
	      the function such as input/output, window view, the core
	      process, etc.
	    - The core process of image examination is only in
	      PixyKernel. It contains only the procesure and can be read
	      as a document about the examination process.
	    - The other classes are very small and designed in object
	      oriented style.
	    - The image, the chart of detected stars, the chart of catalog 
	      data, and the control panel become independent frames. So 4
	      windows appear now.
	* New class files:
	    - package misao.pixy
		AdjoiningPixelSet	MainFrame
		CatalogManager		MapFunctionCandidate
		ChartFrame		PixyInputData
		EventHandler		PixyKernel
		EventManager		PixyOutputData
		ImageFrame		PrintManager
		MagError
	    - package misao.util
		MovingAverage		Printable
	* Changes on star detection:
	    - The two process, adjoining pixels detection and deblending
	      are evidently separated.
	* Changes on matching:
	    - Matching search is operated at one time even if the
	      positional error is large.
	    - The step to create triangles from a tree is fixed as 4 for
	      detected stars, 8 for catalog data.
	    - Too slim triangles are not used for matching.
	    - The triangles whose ratio of sides is large are used at
	      first in matching search, in order to find a map function as 
	      soon as possible.
	    - Detected stars used for verification are also selected
	      equally from all over the image, same as stars used for 
	      matching. The number is three times of those for matching. 
	    - The threshold of score to finish matching search is reduced
	      to 0.5.
	    - The one block ratio of triangles index is changed to 1.1
	      from 1.025, because many triangles were out of index area.
	    - The catalog data out of area is ignored at verification. 
	      Because they were also used in the old version, sometimes a
	      wrong map function happens to have a high score when many
	      noises appear at edge.
	* Changes on pairing:
	    - The search area size is changed:
		In preliminary pairing, 5 pixels and 4 mag.
		In quasi pairing, 3 pixels and 3 mag at least. When the
		error after preliminary pairing is large, the search area
		also becomes large.
		Final pairing consists of two passes. In the first pass, 1 
		pixel at least and no limit for magnitude. In the second
		pass, 3 pixel and 3 mag at least. When the error after
		preliminary pairing is large, the search area also becomes
		large.
		The reason of two passes is to avoid mis-pairs, especially 
		reversal pairs of close stars.
	    - After quasi pairing and final pairing, reject mis-pairs
	      before calculating map function and distortion field.
	    - Those pairs whose positional difference are larger than both 
	      1.5 pixels and 1 arcmin are regarded as mis-pairs and
	      separated. In the old version, most of moving pairs were
	      just mis-pairs when the field of view was large, but now the 
	      problem is solved. 
	* Other changes:
	    - The limit to regard it as blending of close binary stars is
	      set as 1 arcmin. If there are two stars detected within 1
	      arcmin and there is only one star in catalog, it is regarded 
	      as blending.
	    - Bug fix: Stars in part of the catalog chart were completely
	      lacking sometimes when the approximate position was much
	      different. It was bug of a method selectElementAs*.
	    - New GUI function to show a mark at any (x,y) is added.
	    - The background of charts can be painted in black.
	    - Test codes are deleted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Oct  7 08:47:51 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* LogAnalyzer.java: Bug fix to read a log file after examination
	  with USNO-A1.0 in detail mode. And the record of error comes to
	  be output when an exception is thrown.

Fri Oct  2 02:20:53 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* StarListIndex.java: 
	* SelectStarListIndex.java: 
	* TriStars.java: 
	* PositionList.java: 
	* Graph.java: 
	* TriGraph.java: 
	* StarList.java: 
	* DetectList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Matching process is refined. 
	    - So that matching process can obtain a right map function
	      even if the image is biased in oensity, such images as in
	      the midst of the Milky Way, around an open cluster, of a
	      globular cluster, etc. the system divides image into 3x2
	      areas and picks up bright three stars from each block. It
	      also divides the chart into 8x8 areas and picks up bright
	      three stars from each block. In the old version, bright 10
	      stars were selected from the whole image and bright 100
	      stars were selected from the whole chart.
	    - To avoid the bias that a map function with a large
	      magnification rate is much easier to obtained in matching
	      process than that with a small rate, the system connects
	      nearby stars and creates a tree, then creates small
	      triangles with three stars reachable in short steps. In the
	      old version, the system creates all triangles and selects
	      some triangles in random. But now large triangles are never
	      created, so total count of triangles are reduced.

Mon Sep 28 05:59:35 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* CdromListUSNO.java: 
	* CatalogList.java: 
	* CatalogIndex.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Unification of duplicated data in USNO A1.0 catalog
	  is moved to CatalogIndex from CdromListUSNO.
	  Methods unifyDuplicationCdrom() and unifyDuplicationCgi()
	  also unifies duplicated data in GSC catalog.

	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: The system does not use too faint stas in order to
	  calculate a matnitude translation formula. A faint catalog data
	  is detected when it is brighter actually, and is not detected
	  when it is actually faint. But a bright catalog data is always
	  detected whenever it is brighter or fainter than the catalog
	  record. Therefore, including faint stars causes the formula
	  is shifted systematically.

	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Option "Fix gradient of magnitude translation
	  formula as -1" is abolished. The gradient of a magnitude
	  translation formula is always fixed as -1.0.

	* Pixy.java: The size of smoothing filter at expansion of sky
	  field is changed to 16 from 8. Sky field is obtained by median
	  filter with 40x40 size. But because it takes so much time, the
	  system reduces the original image into 1/64 (1/8 x 1/8) at
	  first, then applies median filter to the small image and obtains
	  reduced sky image. Finally the system expands it to the original 
	  size, applying smoothing filter. But the size of smoothing
	  filter was too small and the sky image was squarish. Now the sky 
	  field is smooth.

	* ImagePixy.java: Calculation of a step to separate one group of
	  adjoining pixels into some stars is changed. In the old version, 
	  it often seperated too much and divided one star into some
	  pieces when noise was large, or it could not separates at all
	  and several stars were blended into one when noise was small.
	  Especially if noise was less than 1.0, the step could not
	  calculated.

	* DetectList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: The midway progress and the results are also output
	  to System.out even when saving them into a file. This mode can
	  be controled via enablePrintConsole() and disablePrintConsole().

	* Pixy.java: Test code to check what stars are used for matching
	  is added.

	* Pixy.java: Bug fix. The '\n' code was output directly after the
	  center coordinates of the image.

	* Pixy.java: Order of arguments after option -log is changed.

Tue Sep 15 02:51:54 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* CgiListUSNO.java: 
	* CgiListUSNOVizieR.java: 
	* CdromListUSNO.java: Loading star data also in R or B mag, not
	  only in preliminary V mag, is implemented.

	* CdromListUSNO.java: Buffer size is reduced to avoid
	  OutOfMemory.

	* LogAnalyzer.java: Bug fix to read a log file output at
	  examination with USNO A1.0 in simple format.

Mon Sep 14 06:28:53 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: Blending of close stars within 1.414 pixels becomes
	  done before pairing. And the brightness of such a data becomes
	  the amount of blended stars. This modification causes to avoid
	  several faint stars are close enough to be detected as one star
	  and output as remarkable stars because the measured magnitude
	  are the amount of the close stars, brighter than each star.

	* Astro.java: 
	* StarListIndex.java: 
	* CatalogList.java: Two types of methods are created to blend
	  close several stars into one (StarListIndex#blend()) and to
	  unify several duplicated data of one star into one
	  (StarListIndex#unify()). The method blend() in the old version
	  is renamed as unify().

	* Pixy.java: With an option -log, it can display an image and two
	  charts, the same view as that displayed after examination, from
	  a log file.

	* LogAnalyzer.java: It becomes to have a PairList object as a
	  member. The object can be referenced by getPairList().

	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Class PairList is refined to be simple.
	    - Constructors become simple. Pairing process is implemented
	      as public methods pairingRoughly() and pairingPrecisely(),
	      although they were implemented as constructors in the old
	      version. 
	    - Such secondary member fields as imiting magnitude,
	      magnitude error, positional error, etc., are deleted, so
	      that all methods can be invoked without concerns in the
	      state of PairList object. Methods which requires these
	      fields accepts them as arguments.

	* Pixy.java: Refining of magnitude transolation formula is 
	  abolished. 

	* LogAnalyzer.java: Method getPairList() is renamed as
	  getPairedList(). 

	* LogAnalyzer.java: Some methods are added.

Sat Sep 12 06:21:49 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* DetectList.java:
	* Pixy.java: Matching process is renewed.
	    - Capacity to find similar triangles becomes severe, capacity
	      of (x,y), ratio of edges, rotating angle are reduced 5.0 ->
	      2.0 pixels, 1.05 -> 1.025, 5.0 -> 2.0 deg, respectively.
	    - Prove codes are added to determine if a candidate of map
	      function obtained in repetition is really a map
	      function between the image and the chart. Now the system
	      checks if it is a right map function every time when a
	      candidate is obtained, and it immediately stops repetition
	      when a right one is found. If more than 80% of bright 50
	      detected stars have the counterparts in the chart mapped by
	      the map function, it is judged as right. If no right map
	      function is found after 100 times repetition, the one of the 
	      best score (the rate of detected stars which have the
	      couterparts) is regarded as right. As a result, matching
	      process becomes faster and robuster.

	* TriStarsIndex.java: Mesh size becomes minute, so seeking speed
	  becomes faster.

	* Pixy.java: By ignoring illegal rows/columns, the noise value
	  becomes much smaller in many cases. So the system adopts twice
	  of standard deviation as noise value, although the standard
	  deviation itself was regarded as noise value in the old
	  version. 

	* ImagePixy.java: Instead of equalizing level of every row and
	  column of an image, it ignores such illegal rows and columns by
	  filling them up with median value of each row/column's median
	  value. This change is because such rows and columns are illegal
	  and only contain white noises in the area in most cases. At the
	  same time, the judgment of illegal rows/columns is improved to
	  consider deviation of median value of each row/column, so that
	  it will not ignore valid rows/columns even if the image is not
	  flat.

	* CdromListUSNO.java: Buffering is implemented. Reading a large
	  size of data at one time, the reading speed becomes much
	  faster. 

	* CatalogList.java: 
	* CdromListUSNO.java: Because some stars are recorded twice or
	  more in the USNO A1.0 catalog, it unifies them into one data by
	  invoking CatalogList#unifyDuplication().

	* StarListIndex.java:
	* PairList.java:
	* Pixy.java: The class StarListIndex is moved to misao.util from
	  misao.pixy and generalized. The function to limit magnitude is
	  removed. Method fusion() is renamed as blend().

	* StarList.java: Method limitMagAt() is added.

	* ImageFileFits.java: Reading codes are refined.

	* Astro.java: Method intValueOf() is added.

	* MapFunction.java: Methods setScore() and toString() is added.

Sun Sep  6 02:07:45 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* DetectStarList.java: In order to calculate the position of a
	  star even if it is saturated and the peak is flat and wide, not
	  only 21 top pixels but also some more pixels are used to obtain
	  the center of gravity if the pixel value is more than 80% of
	  that of the 21th pixel.

	* ImageFile.java: Method mirrorHorizontal() and mirrorVertical()
	  is added.

	* Astro.java: New method sortStringList() is added.

Fri Sep  4 12:31:21 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* DetectList.java: The order to search similar triangles in
	  matching becomes random, although the system tried to find
	  similar triangles one by one in order of brightness in the old
	  version. 

	* DetectList.java: 
	* PairList.java: Do not use detected stars at edge for matching
	  and determining limiting magnitude by pairing.

	* ImagePixy.java: 
	* Pixy.java: New function to equalize level of every row and
	  column of an image is added as ImagePixy#equalizeRowColumn().
	  This funciton rolls vertical or horizontal white/dark line,
	  especially being at edges.

	* Pixy.java: The score to finish matching loop is increased from 5
	  to 15, so that the system can find true map function for any
	  images.

	* ImagePixy.java: Many image contains stars spreading over only 1
	  pixel or 2 pixels. So now the system also keeps such small
	  stars, although they were considered as noises and removed at
	  star detection.

	* ImageFileFits.java: 
	* ImageFilePgm.java: 
	* ImageFilePpm.java: Buffering becomes used and reading a file
	  becomes a bit faster. The size is as one line of an image.

	* LogAnalyzer.java: Bug fix. It could not read a log file not in
	  detail at using USNO as reference catalog.

	* PairList.java: Method setFaintestMag() is added.

	* ImagePixy.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Test code to create a positive/negative map is moved
	  into ImagePixy as ImagePixy#binaryAtSky().

	* Pixy.java: Test code to create a distribution area map is
	  deleted. And other test codes are refined.

Wed Sep  2 05:19:26 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* URLString.java: Constructor is updated so that it can read a
	  filename in Windows95 style properly.

	* Pixy.java: Gradient of magnitude translation formula becomes
	  able to be fixed as -1 (actually, fix it by default). This new

Thu Jul 16 22:29:05 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Some changes of result outputs.
	    - Sequential number is output for each data for "Paired
	      stars", "Remarkable paired stars", "Non-paired stars in
	      catalog list" and "Non-paired stars in detected list"
	      independently. 
	    - Number of remarkable pairs whose magnitude or position are
	      different are output.
	    - Remarkable pair data are not listed up in "Paired stars".

	* DetectList.java: Outputs (x,y) of detected stars even if not
	  print records in detail.

	* LogData.java: 
	* LogAnalyzer.java: New class files to analyzer log of PIXY
	  system. 

	* Array.java: 
	* PairList.java: Bug fix. When almost all detected stars are
	  paired, most data were rejected in the old version.

Tue Jul 14 23:57:58 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: Because the preliminary distortion field calculated
	  for the first time is inaccurate, sometimes the system makes
	  mistakes in pairing or fails to find counterparts of detected
	  stars. Therefore, another pairing process is added after the
	  second distortion field is calculated. As a result, pairing
	  process becomes repeated three times.

	* PairList.java: Some changes on pairing.
	    - The default search area size of counterparts is expanded to
	      20x20 pixels from 10x10 pixels. That is only for images with 
	      a few stars.
	    - At the first pairing, search area size determined according
	      to density of stars of the image is expanded twice, because
	      mapping at the early step is inaccurate.
	    - At the first pairing, the system becomes to regard the
	      brightest catalog data in the search area as a counterpart 
	      of the detected star. Although the nearest one was regarded
	      as the counterpart in the old version, it yielded many
	      mis-pairs and the distortion field could not calculated
	      properly, because mapping at the early step is inaccurate.

	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Threshold to output candidates of new objects,
	  catalog data is changed to Lm. and (Lm. - 3 d_mag) respectively
	  from (Lm. - 2 d_mag). However, if the system could load catalog
	  data only brighter than M, candidates fainter than (M - 3 d_mag)
	  are rejected.

	* MagnitudeTranslationFormula.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Re-calculates limiting magnitude after magnitude
	  translation formula is re-calculated according to pairing.

	* DistortionField.java: Method print() is modified.

	* Pixy.java: Loads catalog data from CD-ROM by default.

Mon Jul 13 12:14:39 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Quadrics.java: 
	* Cubics.java: 
	* DistortionField.java: 
	* DetectStarData.java: 
	* DetectList.java: 
	* StarListIndex.java: 
	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: When the field is wide, the image is often
	  crooked. So the system calculates the distortion field as a
	  cubic function of (x,y) and corrects (x,y) of detected stars. As 
	  a result, the positional error always becomes less than a third
	  of the pixel size.

	* StarListIndex.java: 
	* PairList.java: When there are some catalog data in a very small
	  area, each data is within 1.414 pixels from one another, they
	  are fused into one catalog data before pairing. That is because
	  such close data cannot be separated on the image anyway. In the
	  old version, only one of them is paired and others are output as 
	  candidates of catalog data, or others are paired by mistake.

	* PairList.java: To avoid making a pair by mistake, pairing
	  process is changed.
	    - Area size to search a counterpart becomes determined
	      according to density of stars of the image. Though it was
	      fixed as 10x10 pixels in the old version, pairing by mistake
	      happened sometimes especially when there are so many stars.
	    - In the 2nd pairing, the system at first searches a
	      counterpart within a very small area (within positional
	      error), then searches within a wider area (the size is
	      determined according to density of stars). Without this
	      two-way process, the system came to find a counterpart for
	      any bright star even if it is new, especially when there are 
	      so many stars.
	    - In the old version, the system regards the nearest one as a
	      counterpart, but now the system determines a counterpart
	      considering not only positional difference but also
	      magnitude difference. So a catalog data both whose position
	      and magnitude are similar to those of a detected star
	      becomes paired.

	* StarColor.java: 
	* PairList.java: The pair data whose position ise different but
	  magnitude are not different becomes drawn as a blue star.

Sat Jul 11 06:22:43 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: Test codes to check star detection are added.

	* Pixy.java: Stop wasting an-image-size memory in init().

Fri Jul 10 11:22:25 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Histogram.java: 
	* Pixy.java: The level of the original image is automatically
	  arranged to be best to see.

	* ImageCanvas.java: Bug fix. Sometimes the original image was not
	  displayed, especially when expanding the window.

	* StarData.java: Methods shiftXY() and rescaleXY() becomes to work 
	  also on appendix StarData objects. Because it did not, all
	  duplicated GSC data appeared at the center of GSC chart.

Thu Jul  9 21:38:54 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* StarListIndex.java: 
	* PairList.java: Pairing process becomes much faster. Before
	  pairing, every catalog data is classified into one of small
	  (20x20 pixels) block areas. When finding a counterpart of a
	  detected star, the system only searches data in a block where
	  the star locates, and neightbor blocks considering positional
	  error. As a result, pairing takes almost no time.

	* ImageGray.java: Method smooth_average() becomes much faster, but 
	  requires double memory.

Wed Jul  8 06:27:25 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PairList.java: Because the applied magnitude of detected stars
	  at the first step is inaccurate, the system sometimes failed to
	  make a proper pair of a detected star and a catalog data at the
	  preliminary pairing. So the search range of magnitude is
	  expanded from +/- 2 mag to +/- 4 mag by default.

	* Pixy.java: 100 brightest catalog data are used in matching with
	  10 brightest detected stars (in the older version, only 40
	  brightest catalog data are used), so that the system can find
	  several similar triangles certainly.

	* TriStars.java: 
	* TriStarsForm.java: 
	* TriStarsIndex.java: Sometimes there are several quite same data
	  in catalog. So making an index of trianles based on the ratio of 
	  side length, it becomes to throw an exception if a side length
	  is 0.

	* Pixy.java: 0-base point coincidense is abolished. In the older
	  version, the mean value of sky field is higher than the mean
	  value of background pixels. So the system degraded the sky field 
	  so that the average becomes same as that of the background
	  pixels. However, now that the sky field is filtered to be smooth, 
	  the mean value is low enough. Therefore, such an ad hoc process
	  is no longer used.

	* Pixy.java: In the older version, the sky field consists of some
	  8x8-pixel blocks as a result of image compression at applying
	  median filter. Now that the sky field is filtered to be smooth,
	  photometry becomes accurate.

	* ImageGray.java: Bug fix of a method smooth_average().

	* Pixy.java: Print a message before heavy process like star
	  detection, catalog data loading, etc.

	* Pixy.java: Bug fix. The mark of R.A. and Decl. user inputs did
	  not appear at a right position.

	* ImageFilePpm.java: New method save(File file) is added.

Mon Jul  6 17:02:12 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* DetectList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Matching process is changed. In the older version,
	  25 brightest detected stars are selected and 23 triangles are
	  created, then the system searches similar triangles in 100
	  brightest catalog data. But now 10 brightest detected stars are
	  selected and 120 (= 10C3) triangles are created, then the system 
	  searches similar triangles in 40 brightest catalog data. It
	  means matching repetition is increased. The order of repetition
	  becomes O(n^6) from O(n^4). But similar triangles becomes easy
	  to be found, so total time for matching is reduced.

	* PairList.java: Close binary check is changed. If the position or 
	  magnitude of a detected star and a catalog data differs, the
	  catalog data may be actually a close binary. So the system
	  searches another counterpart of the catalog data from non-paired 
	  detected stars list. Here, consider d_pos as the positional
	  difference of the pair (or the error of position of the whole
	  image if d_pos is too small), and d_mag as the error of
	  magnitude estimation of the whole image. If a non-paired
	  detected star is found, whose position difference from the
	  catalog data is less than 2.0*d_pos, and whose magnitude
	  difference from the already paired detected star is less than
	  3.0*d_mag, it is as probable to be a pair of the catalog data as
	  the already paired star. Therefore the non-paired star is
	  regarded as another counterpart.

	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: Output (x,y) of each non-paired catalog data.

	* CatalogCanvas.java: Plot all appendix data of each star data,
	  and show all appendix data in a dialog by mouse clicking.

	* Pixy.java: Bug fix. Sometimes the mark 'r', 'd', 'm' was not
	  printed even if the difference of position or magnitude is
	  large. 

Tue Jun 30 23:18:22 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: In order to detect as many faint stars as possible,
	  and to avoid so many suspicious candidates of new objects
	  appear, determination of the valid limiting magnitude is
	  improved again. Now the system does not let the user to input
	  the maximum number of candidates to be output. It calculates the 
	  valid limiting magnitude selects really remarkable candidates of 
	  new objects automatically. The technique to estimate Lm (the
	  valid limiting magnitude) and dm (error of magnitude) is same as 
	  that in the old version. For each detected star, the system trys 
	  to find the counterpart in catalog until Lm + 2*dm mag. If no
	  counterpart is found, only brighter ones than Lm - 2*dm are
	  reserved as candidates of new objects or catalog errors.

	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: The output of "Paired stars in catalog list" and
	  "Paired stars in detected list" are unified. The measured data
	  and data in catalog are output together for each object. And
	  the data whose position or magnitude differs from those in
	  catalog are listed up independently as "Remarkable paired
	  stars". 

	* CdromListGSC.java: 
	* CdromListUSNO.java: Magnitude condition becomes to be judged
	  before positional condition to select necessary data. Then
	  catalog loading becomes fast, especially when loading data of 
	  large field.

	* PairList.java: Bug fix. Rejecting isolated catalog data near
	  the edge of the image, some data at the bottom of the image were 
	  not rejected.

Mon Jun 29 04:10:29 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* TriStars.java: 
	* TriStarsForm.java: 
	* TriStarsIndex.java: 
	* DetectList.java: Matching process becomes much faster. Before
	  matching, index table of every triangle of three catalog data
	  are created. The key of the index is ratio of side length. So
	  number of trials to calculate a map function is reduced as about 
	  1/100.

	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: To avoid so many candidates of new objects are
	  output, determination of the valid limiting magnitude is
	  improved. An option to set the maximum number of candidates to
	  be output is added. If more candidates are found in the way of
	  the old version, the system raises the limiting magnitude so
	  that the number of candidates becomes same as the number an user 
	  inputs. Considering the error of magnitude estimation, the
	  magnitude of the faintest candidates equals the valid limiting
	  magnitude - the error of photometry.

	* Pixy.java: To detect very faint stars, threshold is reduced to
	  "noise" value from twice of "noise" value.

	* DetectStarData.java: 
	* DetectList.java: 
	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: To avoid mistakes of automatic cosmic ray rejection,
	  the system marks up candidates of cosmic ray at detection
	  process. After matching and pairing, the system removes isolated 
	  candidates (non-paired ones) as real cosmic ray. In this way, a
	  real star will not be removed by mistake. So threshold to regard 
	  as a cosmic ray is reduced to 0.4 from 0.5.

	* Pixy.java: Three mode are prepared for record field. It can be
	  null, simple data and information in detail. To avoid "Out Of
	  Memory" problem, an option to omit record field of each star
	  data is added.

	* Pixy.java: Number of pixels for astrometry is incraesed to 21
	  from 5 for more accuracy.

	* Pixy.java: Output format of "Pairing results" is changed.

Sun Jun 28 06:24:46 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: The process of matching, astrometry and photometry is
	  updated. Before matching, only some bright stars are read from
	  catalog. The data contains only (x,y) and magnitude, minimum set
	  required for matching. After an approximate map function is
	  obtained, the system read catalog data again just around the
	  center of the image, then all data of bright and faint stars are
	  read. It means to stop wasting memory, especially when position
	  error is large and search area is wide, and to be faster because 
	  number of stars to sort is reduced.

	* DetectList.java: 
	* PairList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: After applying magnitude to detected stars at the
	  first step, the system calculates magnitude translation formula
	  and converts pixel values into magnitude by the formula. Only
	  applying magnitude was sufficient in the old version, but now
	  that only a few stars are read from catalog before matching,
	  most of faint detected stars cannot be applied the magnitude in
	  that way. Because only bright stars are used to calculate the
	  formula, the gradient is fixed as -1.0.

	* DetectList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: The parameter d_mag for matching becomes to set
	  dynamically in Pixy.java as twice of error of the magnitude
	  translation formula at the first step, or 2.0 mag at least.

	* CgiListUSNOVizieR.java: 
	* CgiListYcbs.java: 
	* CgiList.java: 
	* CatalogIndex.java: 
	* Pixy.java: The "record" of each catalog data is not necessary
	  for matching. So record can be set as null optionally.

	* CatalogList.java: 
	* Pixy.java: For intelligibility, method selectElement() is
	  separated into selectElementAsReference() and	
	  selectElementAsCopy().

Fri Jun 26 05:10:24 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* Pixy.java: Bug fix. The fielf of view to read catalog data was
	  wrong. 

	* CdromListUSNO.java: Bug fix. Stars between 23h45m and 24h00m
	  were not read.

	* Coor.java: Bug fix. Constructor Coor(ra_h,ra_m,ra_s,south_flag,

	* ImageCanvas.java: Method update(Graphics) is added.

Wed Jun 24 02:56:41 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* First official release of Java package. 
	    - The UNIX version (Java and C) is translated into completely
	      Java. 
	    - The older UNIX version will never be updated.

	* Main changes.
	    - Whole system is reconstructed in object-oriented disign.
	    - Matching process never use a voting table to find a true map 
	      function. Now it calculates 6 parameters of affine
	      transformation in the least square method, then determine if
	      the triangles are really similar, and if so, add 6
	      parameters to Vector object. If there is already similar
	      parameter set in the Vector object, just counts up the
	      score. So it will never require so large memory.
	    - Star detection process becomes much simpler in two
	      points. First, the noise value (threshold to detect star
	      pixels) is twice of the standard deviation of difference
	      between pixel value and sky level. Determining threshold so
	      that one star may have about 100 pixels around, the way in
	      the older version, is not used now, however the technique
	      will be used again in the future. Second, the "calculates
	      PSF radius -> distributes pixel values to all detected
	      stars" process is executed once, although it was executed
	      twice repeatedly in the older version.
	    - Top 5 pixels becomes to be used for astrometry. In the old
	      version, often only one pixel is used and the position (x,y)
	      of the star was integer. Now the astrometry becomes more
	      precise. Using the center of gravity of all pixels as the
	      position brings accuracy worse, especially in the case of a
	      diffused object. So 5 pixels are used.
	    - When distributing each pixel value to three detected stars,
	      the size of area where a detected star's power influence is
	      expanded. The threshold is reduced to 1.0 from noise value.
	    - Before applying median filter, the image is compressed as
	      8x8 block becomes one pixel. And after applying the filter,
	      the median image is expanded 8x8 times. It reduces much
	      time.

	* mainCatalogLoader.java:
	* mainPixy.java: The original Hipprcos/Tycho Catalogue online
	  search service and the USNO A1.0 online search service at VizieR

	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c: Aperture PSF photometry. The
	  process is as follows. 
	    1. Calculate the center of gravity, peak value and PSF radius
	       of each star in the old way of star detection (threshold
	       method by steps). The PSF is assumed as Gaussian
	       distribution and calculated in the least square method.
	    2. Calculate influence of all detected stars for each pixel.
	    3. Distribute the pixel value of each pixel for all detected
	       stars according to the influence. In fact, determine three
	       owner stars for each pixel and distribute the pixel value
	       for only the three stars. Aperture size is 20 pixels in
	       this stage.
	    4. Calculate again the peak value and PSF radius of each star
	       with distributed pixel values. In this stage, the peak
	       value is also calculated in the least square method.
	    5. Calculate again influence of all detected stars for each
	       pixel.
	    6. Distribute again the pixel value of each pixel for all
	       detected stars according to the influence. In fact,
	       determine three owner stars for each pixel and distribute
	       the pixel value for only the three stars. Aperture size is
	       (20 * PSF radius) pixels in this stage.
	    7. Sum up the distributed pixel values for each star, which
	       becomes the brightness of the star.

	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c: Background sky level comes to be
	  estimated more precisely. It causes the magnitude estimation of
	  diffused objects (like comets) becomes better.

	* StarDetector.java:
	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c:
	* mainPixy.java: Option to assume that the image is flat is
	  added. It causes the magnitude estimation of diffused objects
	  (like comets) becomes better.

	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c: Height of steps to find peaks at
	  star detection comes to be changed according to the current
	  pixel value. It is to reduce noise detection especially around
	  a bright star.

	* StarDetector.java:
	* mainPixy.java: Cosmic ray rejection becomes optional, because it
	  does not work well for GIF or JPEG images.

	* StarData.java:
	* StarDetector.java:
	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c:
	* mainPixy.java: If a detected star is at the edge of the image,
	  the magnitude will be incorrect, so a mark '*' is added at the
	  end of data.

	* CdromLoaderGSC.java:
	* CdromLoaderUSNO.java:
	* mainCatalogLoader.java:
	* mainPixy.java: The system can read star data from CD-ROMs. The
	  Guide Star Catalog (ver. 1.1), the USNO-A1.0 are supported.

	* StarData.java:
	* mainCatalogLoader.java:
	* mainPixy.java: Modified in order to list up all duplicated data
	  in catalog. In mainPixy.java, output putting '+' on column 3.

	* mainPixy.java: If a star in catalog is actually close binary
	  stars A and B in the image, it outputs the measured data A and B 
	  continuously, putting '+' on column 3 in record B.

	* StarData.java:
	* StarDetector.java:
	* mainPixy.java: Output PSF radius for each detected star instead
	  of slope.

	* StarData:
	* StarDetector:
	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c:
	* mainPixy.java: In order to avoid alarms on faint stars very
	  close to a bright star or duplicate data in catalog as those
	  only in catalog and not found on the image (non-paired stars in
	  catalog list), new member fields "radius" and "contain" are
	  added to class StarData. If a catalog data A is within the
	  radius of a detected stars already paired with another data B, A
	  is regarded as not seen behind B or duplicate data of B. So the
	  "contain" of B comes to refer to A. Then B and A are output
	  continuously, putting '+' on column 3 in record A.

	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c: Decrease limit the number of
	  pixels for a star down to 100 while dynamic threshold
	  coefficient decision.

	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c: Restore height of noise to
	  separate a close binary down to sigma from 2*sigma, for better
	  photometry of close binary.

	* Pairing.java: If a detected star and data in catalog are not
	  paired only becase the magnitude are very different but the
	  positions are same, make them a pair after ordinary pairing.

	* Pairing.java: Select data only in catalog. Reject fainter ones
	  than (valid limiting magnitude - magnitude error), or ones
	  within 5 pixels from edges.

Sun May  3 19:02:14 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* StarList.java: Changed to add references to each element 
	  in constractor StarList(StarList sl) and a member function
	  add(StarList sl), although each element was duplicated in older
	  version.

	* Pairing.java:
	* CatalogCanvas.java:
	* mainPixy.java: Draw a star by orange color if the measured
	  position or magnitude is very different from that in catalog.

	* mainPixy.java: Increase threshold to judge the position is very
	  different from that in catalog up to 3*d_RA, 3*d_Decl from
	  2*d_RA, 2*d_Decl respectively.

	* mainPixy.java: Calculate magnitude of detected stars by the
	  least square method in 2 pass, to reject bad influence of
	  illegal pairs.

Sun May  3 02:08:44 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* mainPixy.java: New step to re-calculate quasi map function after 
	  preliminary paring is added in order to ensure all pairs between 
	  detected stars and catalog data are get paired properly.

	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c: Bug fix. In older version,
	  magnitude of the fainter one of a pair of close binary star was
	  estimated much brighter than actual. In addition, star detection 
	  process becomes a bit faster. 

	* StarDetector.java:
	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c:
	* Pairing.java: Reject stars within one pixel from edges.

	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c: Increase height of noise to
	  separate a close binary up to 2*sigma from sigma, in order to
	  avoid many false alarms around very bright stars.

	* StarData.java:
	* StarDetector.java:
	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c:
	* mainPixy.java: Output "slope" value for each detected star,
	    slope = (pixel value at peak) / (total amount of pixel value)
	    cf. slope > 0.5: probably cosmic ray
		slope < 0.1: maybe nebula

	* StarDetector.java:
	* mainPixy.java: Function to reject cosmic ray automatically is
	  added (cosmic ray if "slope" is greater than 0.5). 

	* mainPixy.java: Output "mag" and "slope" in fixed length of
	  detected stars.

	* Matching.java: Increase limit of stars number used for matching
	  up to 50 from 20, just for safety.

Sat May  2 18:06:52 JST 1998  S. Yoshida (seiichi@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp)

	* mainPixy.java: Conversion from pixel value into magnitude of
	  each star comes to be approximated by
		mag = A log (pixel value) + B    (A is about -1)
	  although it was approximated by cubic equation of log (pixel
	  value) in old version, which caused systematic errors.

	* misao_pixy_StarDetectorImp.c: Make it to keep monotone
	  increasing or decreasing while dynamic threshold coefficient
	  decision.

	* CatalogLoaderGSC.java: 0 padding for GSC number.

	* mainPixy.java: Fix output bug of range_error.
